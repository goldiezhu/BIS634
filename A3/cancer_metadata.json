        "AbstractText": "Treatment options are limited after the failure of first-and second-line treatments in patients with HER2+ metastatic gastric cancer (mGC). The present study aimed to explore the efficacy, safety, and prognostic factors of apatinib efficacy as a third-line therapy for patients with human epithelial growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) mGC. A total of 59 HER2+ mGC patients who received apatinib as third-line therapy were retrospectively enrolled in this two-center, single-arm, cohort study; the clinical response, survival data, and adverse events were retrieved. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.9-6.5), and the median overall survival (OS) was 8.2 months (95% CI, 6.6-9.8) Furthermore, forward stepwise multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that a higher Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score and multiple metastases were independently correlated with decreased PFS and OS (both P<0.05). The main adverse events were leukopenia (45.8%), hypertension (44.1%), thrombocytopenia (39.0%), hand-foot syndrome (37.3%), and elevated transaminase (33.9%). Grade 3 adverse events mainly included hypertension (5.1%) and neutropenia (5.1%); grade 4 adverse events did not occur. Apatinib is efficient and well tolerated in patients with HER2+ mGC as a third-line treatment, suggesting that it may be a candidate of choice for these patients. ",

        "AbstractText": "This study aimed to investigate the relationship between clinical and laboratory parameters and complication status to predict which patients can be safely discharged from the hospital on the third postoperative day (POD). Data from a prospectively maintained database of 2,110 consecutive patients with gastric adenocarcinoma who underwent curative surgery were reviewed. The third POD vital signs, laboratory data, and details of the course after surgery were collected. Patients with grade II or higher complications after the third POD were considered unsuitable for early discharge. The performance metrics were calculated for all algorithm parameters. The proposed algorithm was tested using a validation dataset of consecutive patients from the same center. Of 1,438 patients in the study cohort, 142 (9.9%) were considered unsuitable for early discharge. C-reactive protein level, body temperature, pulse rate, and neutrophil count had good performance metrics and were determined to be independent prognostic factors. An algorithm consisting of these 4 parameters had a negative predictive value (NPV) of 95.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94.2-97.3), sensitivity of 80.3% (95% CI, 72.8-86.5), and specificity of 51.1% (95% CI, 48.3-53.8). Only 28 (1.9%) patients in the study cohort were classified as false negatives. In the validation dataset, the NPV was 93.7%, sensitivity was 66%, and 3.3% (17/512) of patients were classified as false negatives. Simple clinical and laboratory parameters obtained on the third POD can be used when making decisions regarding the safe early discharge of patients who underwent gastrectomy. ",

This study aimed to elucidate the clinical characteristics, endoscopic features including fundic gland polyposis (FGPsis), and treatment outcomes of gastric neoplasms (GNs) in patients with FAP. A total of 35 patients diagnosed with FAP, including nine patients from four pedigrees who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), were investigated regarding patient characteristics, GN morphology, and treatment outcomes. Twenty-one patients (60.0%) had 38 GNs; 33 (86.8%) and 5 (13.2%) were histologically diagnosed with adenocarcinoma and adenoma, respectively. There were no specific patient characteristics related to GNs. Nodule-type GNs were more prevalent in patients with FGP than without (52.2% vs. 0.0%, P=0.002) in the upper body of the stomach. Conversely, depressed-type GNs were fewer in patients with FGPsis than in those without (13.0% vs. 73.3%, P<0.001). Slightly elevated-type GNs were observed in both groups (34.8% vs. 20.0%, P=0.538). Even within pedigrees, the background gastric mucosa and types of GNs varied. In total, 24 GNs were treated with endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and eight with endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). EMR was selected for GNs with FGPsis because of the technical difficulty of ESD, resulting in a lower en bloc resection rate (62.5% vs. 100%, P=0.014). Our study indicates the necessity of routine EGD surveillance in patients diagnosed with FAP. Notably, the morphology and location of GNs differed between patients with and without FGPsis. Endoscopic treatment and outcomes require more attention in cases of FGPsis. ",

We sought to elucidate the recurrent patterns according to tumor locations in RGC. Data were collected from the Shanghai Cancer Center between January 2006 and December 2020. A total of 129 patients with RGC were included in this study, of whom 62 had carcinomas at the anastomotic site (group A) and 67 at the non-anastomotic site (group N). The clinicopathological characteristics, surgical results, recurrent diseases, and survival were investigated according to tumor location. The time interval from the previous gastrectomy to the current diagnosis was 32.0&#177;13.0 and 21.0&#177;13.4 years in groups A and N, respectively. The previous disease was benign in 51/62 cases (82.3%) in group A and 37/67 cases (55.2%) in group N (P=0.002).

We investigated the associations between SNVs in candidate genes, PLK2, PLK3, and ATM, and GC risk and clinicopathological features. The genotyping study included 542 patients with GC and healthy controls. Generalized linear models were used for the risk and clinicopathological association analyses. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The binding of candidate miRs was analyzed using a luciferase reporter assay. The PLK2 Crs15009-Crs963615 haplotype was under-represented in the GC group compared to that in the control group (Pcorr=0.050). Male patients with the PLK2 rs963615 CT genotype had a lower risk of GC, whereas female patients had a higher risk (P=0.023; P=0.026). The PLK2 rs963615 CT genotype was associated with the absence of vascular invasion (P=0.012). The PLK3 rs12404160 AA genotype was associated with a higher risk of GC in the male population (P=0.015). The ATM Trs228589-Ars189037-Grs4585 haplotype was associated with a higher risk of GC (P<0.001). The ATM rs228589, rs189037, and rs4585 genotypes TA+AA, AG+GG, and TG+GG were associated with the absence of perineural invasion (P=0.034). In vitro analysis showed that the cancer-associated miR-23b-5p mimic specifically bound to the PLK2 rs15009 G allele (P=0.0097). Moreover, low miR-23b expression predicted longer 10-year survival (P=0.0066) in patients with GC. PLK2, PLK3, and ATM SNVs could potentially be helpful for the prediction of GC risk and clinicopathological features. PLK2 rs15009 affects the binding of miR-23b-5p.

We aimed to determine the rate of extragastric metastasis (EGM) and identify the predictors of EGM in patients with negative resection margins (R0 resection) and lymphovascular invasion in post-ESD pathology. A total of 2,983 patients underwent ESD for EGC. Among them, 110 had a pathology of R0 resection and positive lymphovascular invasion. Patients underwent additional gastrectomy (n=63) or further follow-up without gastrectomy (n=47). The 110 patients were assigned to one of the 3 groups according to ESD indications based on post-ESD pathology. The first group satisfied the absolute indication for ESD (n=18), the second group satisfied the expanded indications for ESD (n=34), and the last group satisfied the beyond indication (n=58). The number of occurrences of EGM in each group was 1 (5.6%), 3 (8.8%), and 3 (5.2%), respectively. The logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, tumor size, and indication for ESD, showed that larger tumor size was associated with EGM (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-3.10; P=0.048). In contrast, ESD indication criteria did not affect EGM (P=0.349). Tumor size was the only predictive indicator for EGM in patients who underwent R0 resection and lymphovascular invasion on post-ESD pathology. Even patients with pathology corresponding to the absolute indication criteria of ESD had lymphovascular invasion, which means that they require additional gastrectomy due to the risk of EGM. ",

Therefore, development of new treatment strategies is necessary. We aimed to identify the mechanism underlying Sp1 regulation of GC progression. The levels of Sp1, &#946;-catenin, SET domain bifurcated 1 (SETDB1), and 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD) were detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. The targets of SETDB1 were predicted by AnimalTFDB, and dual-luciferase reporter assay was used for confirming the combination of Sp1, &#946;-catenin, and SETDB1. HGC27 or AGS cells (1&#215;106 cells/mouse) were injected into mice via the caudal vein for GC model establishment. The level of Ki67 was detected using immunohistochemistry, and hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed for evaluating tumor metastasis in mice with GC. HPGD was inhibited, while the protein levels of Sp1, &#946;-catenin, and SETDB1 were up-regulated in GC tissues and cell lines. HPGD overexpression or SETDB1 silencing inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and migration of GC cells, and Sp1 regulated the proliferation, invasion, and migration of GC cells in a &#946;-catenin-dependent manner. Furthermore, HPGD served as a target of SETDB1, and it was negatively regulated by SETDB1; additionally, Sp1 and &#946;-catenin bound to the SETDB1 promoter and negatively regulated HPGD expression. We proved that Sp1 regulated GC progression via the SETDB1/HPGD axis. Our findings revealed that Sp1 transcriptionally inhibited HPGD via SETDB1 in a &#946;-catenin-dependent manner and promoted the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells. ",

Endoscopic assessment represents the most reliable imaging method for GC diagnosis; however, it is semi-invasive and costly and heavily depends on the skills of the endoscopist, which limit its clinical applicability. Therefore, the search for new sensitive biomarkers for the early detection of GC using noninvasive sampling collection methods has attracted much attention among scientists. Urine is considered an ideal biofluid, as it is readily accessible, less complex, and relatively stable than plasma and serum. Over the years, substantial progress has been made in screening for potential urinary biomarkers for GC.

Although the widely used morphological classifications may be helpful for endoscopic or surgical treatment choices, they are still insufficient to guide precise and/or personalized therapy for individual patients. Recent advances in genomic technology and high-throughput analysis may improve the understanding of molecular pathways associated with GC pathogenesis and aid in the classification of GC at the molecular level. Advances in next-generation sequencing have enabled the identification of several genetic alterations through single experiments. Thus, understanding the driver alterations involved in gastric carcinogenesis has become increasingly important because it can aid in the discovery of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In this article, we review the molecular classifications of GC, focusing on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) classification. We further describe the currently available biomarker-targeted therapies and potential biomarker-guided therapies. This review will help clinicians by providing an inclusive understanding of the molecular pathology of GC and may assist in selecting the best treatment approaches for patients with GC. ",

We aimed to measure the impact of COVID-19 on gastric cancer screening rates based on age, sex, household income, and residential area. We analyzed data from the Korean National Cancer Screening Survey from 2017 to 2021 for adults aged 40-74 years. We evaluated the gastric cancer screening rate within two years in accordance with the National Cancer Screening Program protocol recommendations and that within the previous year.

Although a similar trend was observed for the upper endoscopy screening rate, the upper gastrointestinal series screening rate decreased from 7.8% in 2020 to 3.1% in 2021. During the pandemic, the screening rate decreased among younger adults (40-49), those residing in metropolitan regions, and those with high incomes. Despite a decline in gastric cancer screening rate during the COVID-19 pandemic, the rate surged in 2021.

Depletion of L-Arg has detrimental consequences for T cells and leads to T-cell dysfunction and suppression of anticancer immune responses. Previous work from our group has demonstrated the presence of proinflammatory ARG2-specific CD4 T cells that inhibited tumor growth in murine models on activation with ARG2-derived peptides. In this study, we investigated the natural occurrence of ARG2-specific CD8 T cells in both healthy donors (HDs) and patients with cancer, along with their immunomodulatory capabilities in the context of the TME. A library of 15 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted ARG2-derived peptides were screened in HD peripheral blood mononuclear cells using interferon gamma (IFN-&#947;) ELISPOT. ARG2-specific CD8 T-cell responses were identified using intracellular cytokine staining and ARG2-specific CD8 T-cell cultures were established by enrichment and rapid expansion following in vitro peptide stimulation. The reactivity of the cultures toward ARG2-expressing cells, including cancer cell lines and activated regulatory T cells (Tregs), was assessed using IFN-&#947; ELISPOT and a chromium release assay. The Treg signature was validated based on proliferation suppression assays, flow cytometry and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). In addition, vaccinations with ARG2-derived epitopes were performed in the murine Pan02 tumor model, and induction of ARG2-specific T-cell responses was evaluated with IFN-&#947; ELISPOT. RNAseq and subsequent GO-term and ImmuCC analysis was performed on the tumor tissue. We describe the existence of ARG2-specific CD8+ T cells and demonstrate these CD8+ T-cell responses in both HDs and patients with cancer. ARG2-specific T cells recognize and react to an ARG2-derived peptide presented in the context of HLA-B8 and exert their cytotoxic function against cancer cells with endogenous ARG2 expression. We demonstrate that ARG2-specific T cells can specifically recognize and react to activated Tregs with high ARG2 expression. Finally, we observe tumor growth suppression and antitumorigenic immunomodulation following ARG2 vaccination in an in vivo setting. These findings highlight the ability of ARG2-specific T cells to modulate the immunosuppressive TME and suggest that ARG2-based immunomodulatory vaccines may be an interesting option for cancer immunotherapy.

OX40 receptor occupancy was maintained over 90% among all patients receiving doses of &#8805;200 mg, while no treatment-emergent antidrug antibodies were detected across all dose levels. Pharmacodynamic results demonstrated that treatment with INCAGN01949 did not enhance proliferation or activation of T cells in peripheral blood or reduce circulating Tregs, and analyses of tumor biopsies did not demonstrate any consistent increase in effector T-cell infiltration or function, or decrease in infiltrating Tregs. No safety concerns were observed with INCAGN01949 monotherapy in patients with metastatic or advanced solid tumors. However, tumor responses and pharmacodynamic effects on T cells in peripheral blood and post-therapy tumor biopsies were limited. Studies evaluating INCAGN01949 in combination with other therapies are needed to further evaluate the potential of OX40 agonism as a therapeutic approach in patients with advanced solid tumors.

Expression of CMG2, oestrogen receptor (ER) and androgen receptor (AR) was determined in breast and prostate cancer cell lines, respectively, using real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR) and western blot. Association between CMG2 and sex hormone receptors was analysed in a number of transcriptome datasets. Immunochemical staining was performed in tissue microarrays of breast cancer (BR1505D) and prostate cancer (PR8011A). CMG2 expression was determined in 17&#946;-oestradiol treated breast cancer cells and AR over-expressing prostate cancer cells. CMG2 was found to be inversely correlated with sex hormone receptors in breast and prostate cancer. Lower expression of CMG2 was associated with a poor prognosis in ER (+) breast cancer but not ER (-) tumours. Both ER (+) breast cancer cell lines and AR (+) prostate cancer cell lines presented lower expression of CMG2, which was increased following sex hormone deprivation. Exposure to 17-&#946;-oestradiol and AR over-expression repressed CMG2 expression in breast cancer and prostate cancer cell lines, respectively. CMG2 is inversely correlated with ER and AR status in breast and prostate cancer, respectively. ER and AR mediate repression of CMG2 expression in corresponding cancerous cells. ",

        "AbstractText": "The Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene encodes a protein (pVHL) that plays an important role in proteasome degradation of hypoxia inducible factor &#945; (HIF&#945;) through E3 activation. Accumulation of HIF&#945; by loss of functional pVHL promotes tumorigenesis, thus, VHL has tumor suppressor gene capability in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). VHL is the most frequently mutated gene in ccRCC. The complete loss of VHL is mainly achieved by loss of chromosome 3p, which has a VHL coding region in combination with mutation or hypermethylation of the remaining copy of VHL. Given the risk of constitutional chromosome 3 translocation for RCC, it is important to detect the translocation and understand the mechanism underlying the development of multifocal ccRCC. A 67-year-old female patient diagnosed with multifocal RCC underwent robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) for three kidney tumors. A cancer gene panel test using next generation sequencing (NGS) detected differential VHL mutations (c.533T>G; p.L178R, c.465_466insTA; p.T157Ifs*3, c.343C>A; p.H115N), while VHL mutation was not detected in peripheral blood DNA. A tendency toward copy number loss of genes on der(3) was also detected in all tumors, but not in the germline one. A karyotype analysis revealed a germline translocation between 3 and 6, t(3;6)(q12;q14). Chromosome 3 translocation and loss of derivative chromosome containing 3p and subsequent somatic differential VHL mutations in this case strongly support the previously proposed three-step model to explain the development of familial conventional ccRCC.

TMED9 has been implicated in various cancer types; however, its role in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is unclear. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role and clinical significance of TMED9 in EOC. mRNA and protein levels of TMED9 and their associations with clinicopathological features in EOCs were evaluated using RNA-sequencing and immunohistochemistry data. Functional studies assessing the tumorigenic role of TMED9 in EOC cell lines were also performed. The mRNA expression of TMED9 was up-regulated in EOC compared to that in normal ovarian epithelium. TMED9 protein expression increased in progression from normal ovarian epithelium to EOC (p<0.001). Moreover, high expression of TMED9 was associated with advanced stage, serous cell type and poor histological grade in EOC and demonstrated independent prognostic significance for both disease-free and overall survival. Further functional studies showed that TMED9 knockdown reduced migration, invasion, cell proliferation, and colony formation of EOC cells. Overall, our results support the use of TMED9 as a valuable prognostic biomarker and provide evidence for targeting of TMED9 as a novel strategy for EOC treatment. ",

Patients with MLCS and MLA presented with more advanced-stage disease than those with CECS. They also exhibited post-treatment recurrence and lung metastases more frequently than CECS. Disease-free survival rates of MLCS and MLA were shorter than those of CECS. Tumor protein 53 gene mutations were detected in four MLCS cases.

        "AbstractText": "Although fusion genes involving the proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase ROS1 are rare in pediatric glioma, targeted therapies with small inhibitors are increasingly being approved for histology-agnostic fusion-positive solid tumors. Here, we present a 16-month-old boy, with a brain tumor in the third ventricle. The patient underwent complete resection but relapsed two years after diagnosis and underwent a second operation. The tumor was initially classified as a low-grade glioma (WHO grade 2); however, methylation profiling suggested the newly WHO-recognized type: infant-type hemispheric glioma. To further refine the molecular background, and search for druggable targets, whole genome (WGS) and whole transcriptome (RNA-Seq) sequencing was performed. Concomitant WGS and RNA-Seq analysis revealed several segmental gains and losses resulting in complex structural rearrangements and fusion genes. Among the top-candidates was a novel TPR::ROS1 fusion, for which only the 3' end of ROS1 was expressed in tumor tissue, indicating that wild type ROS1 is not normally expressed in the tissue of origin. Functional analysis by Western blot on protein lysates from transiently transfected HEK293 cells showed the TPR::ROS1 fusion gene to activate the MAPK-, PI3K- and JAK/STAT- pathways through increased phosphorylation of ERK, AKT, STAT and S6. The downstream pathway activation was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry on tumor tissue slides from the patient. We have mapped the activated oncogenic pathways of a novel ROS1-fusion gene and broadened the knowledge of the newly recognized infant-type glioma subtype. The finding facilitates suitable targeted therapies for the patient in case of relapse. ",

Matched biopsies of cervical carcinoma before, during, and after therapy from patients treated with ART were investigated for induction of apoptosis (TUNEL assay) and expression of Wilms Tumor protein 1 (WT1), 14-3-3 &#950;, cluster of differentiation markers (CD4, CD8, CD56), ATP-binding cassette transporter B5 (ABCB5), glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP), eukaryotic elongation factor 3 (eIF3), and ADP/ATP translocase by immunohistochemistry. WT1 has been selected for more detailed analyses using molecular docking in silico, microscale thermophoresis using recombinant WT1, and cytotoxicity testing (resazurin assay) using HEK293 cells transfected with four different WT1 splice variants. The fraction of apoptotic cells and the expression of WT1, 14-3-3 &#950;, and CD4 increased upon ART treatment in tumors of patients. ART was bound in silico to a domain located at the DNA-binding site of WT1, while dihydroartemisinin (DHA) was bound with low affinity to a different site of WT1 not related to DNA-binding. The results were verified using microscale thermophoresis, where ART but not DHA bound to recombinant WT1.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the expression of KISS1 and KISS1R in breast carcinomas from African American (AA) women and correlate their association with clinicopathological features, including breast cancer subtypes, and outcomes. Tissue microarrays were constructed from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded surgical blocks from 216 AA patients. KISS1 and KISS1R expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Univariate analysis was used to determine the association between the expression of KISS1 and KISS1R, and clinicopathological characteristics. Pearson correlation was also determined between immunohistochemical H-scores, tumor size, and the number of positive lymph nodes. Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall and disease-free survival were plotted, and log-rank tests were performed to compare estimates among groups. KISS1 protein expression was found to be higher in receptor-negative and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) compared to other subtypes (p<0.001). However, KISS1R expression was higher in non-TNBC tumors compared to other subtypes (p<0.001). Higher KISS1R expression was marginally negatively correlated with tumor size (p=0.077), and positively correlated with lymph-node positivity (p=0.056), and disease-free survival (p=0.092).

Such genes may encode chimeric proteins when two protein-coding regions fuse in-frame, or they may result in deregulation of genes via promoter swapping or translocation of the gene into the vicinity of a highly active regulatory element. A less studied consequence of chromosomal translocations is the fusion of two breakpoint genes resulting in an out-of-frame chimera. The breaks then occur in one or both protein-coding regions forming a stop codon in the chimeric transcript shortly after the fusion point. Though the latter genetic events and mechanisms at first awoke little research interest, careful investigations have established them as neither rare nor inconsequential. In the present work, we review and discuss the truncation of genes in neoplastic cells resulting from chromosomal rearrangements, especially from seemingly balanced translocations. ",

To overcome PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition in DCs, we developed a novel adeno-associated virus (meAAV) neoantigen vaccine, modified with TLR9 inhibitory fragments, PD-1 trap, and PD-L1 miRNA, which extend the persistence of meAAV and activate neoantigen-specific T-cell responses in immune-competent colorectal and breast cancer murine models. Moreover, we found that in combination with radiotherapy, the meAAV-based neoantigen cancer vaccine not only elicited higher antigen presentation ability, but also maintained neoantigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. These functional PD-1 traps and PD-L1 miRNAs overcome host PD1/PD-L1 inhibitory mechanisms and boost the therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy. More importantly, combined radiotherapy and meAAV neoantigen cancer vaccines significantly enhanced neoantigen-specific CTL responses, increased CTL infiltration in tumor microenvironment, and decreased tumor-associated immunosuppression. This process led to the complete elimination of colorectal cancer and delayed tumor growth of breast cancer in tumor-bearing mice. Taken together, our results demonstrated a novel strategy that combines neoantigen cancer vaccine and radiotherapy to increase the therapeutic efficacy against colorectal and breast cancers. ",

Therefore, small molecules, which are able to image this KCa3.1 channel in vitro and in vivo represent valuable diagnostic and prognostic tool compounds. The [18F]fluoroethyltriazolyl substituted senicapoc was used as positron emission tomography (PET) tracer and showed promising properties for imaging of KCa3.1 channels in lung adenocarcinoma cells in mice. The novel senicapoc Bodipy conjugates with two F-atoms (9a) and with a F-atom and a methoxy moiety ()9b) at the B-atom led to the characteristic punctate staining pattern resulting from labeling of single KCa3.1 channels in A549-3R cells. This punctate pattern was completely removed by preincubation with an excess of senicapoc confirming the high specificity of KCa3.1 labeling. Due to the methoxy moiety at the B-atom and the additional oxyethylene unit in the spacer, 9b exhibits higher polarity, which improves solubility and handling without reduction of fluorescence quantum yield. Docking studies using a cryo-electron microscopy (EM) structure of the KCa3.1 channel confirmed the interaction of 9a and 9b with a binding pocket in the channel pore. ",

        "ArticleTitle": "Prognostic Value of FLT3-Internal Tandem Duplication Residual Disease in Acute Myeloid Leukemia. ",
        "AbstractText": "The applicability of FLT3-internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD) for assessing measurable residual disease (MRD) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in complete remission (CR) has been hampered by patient-specific duplications and potential instability of FLT3-ITD during relapse. Here, we comprehensively investigated the impact of next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based FLT3-ITD MRD detection on treatment outcome in a cohort of patients with newly diagnosed AML in relation to established prognostic factors at diagnosis and other MRD measurements, ie, mutant NPM1 and multiparameter flow cytometry. In 161 patients with de novo FLT3-ITD AML, NGS was performed at diagnosis and in CR after intensive remission induction treatment. FLT3-ITD MRD status was correlated with the cumulative incidence of relapse and overall survival (OS). NGS-based FLT3-ITD MRD was present in 47 of 161 (29%) patients with AML. Presence of FLT3-ITD MRD was associated with increased risk of relapse (4-year cumulative incidence of relapse, 75% FLT3-ITD MRD v 33% no FLT3-ITD MRD; P < .001) and inferior OS (4-year OS, 31% FLT3-ITD MRD v 57% no FLT3-ITD MRD; P < .001). In multivariate analysis, detection of FLT3-ITD MRD in CR confers independent prognostic significance for relapse (hazard ratio, 3.55; P < .001) and OS (hazard ratio 2.51; P = .002). Strikingly, FLT3-ITD MRD exceeds the prognostic value of most generally accepted clinical and molecular prognostic factors, including the FLT3-ITD allelic ratio at diagnosis and MRD assessment by NGS-based mutant NPM1 detection or multiparameter flow cytometry. NGS-based detection of FLT3-ITD MRD in CR identifies patients with AML with profound risk of relapse and death that outcompetes the significance of most established prognostic factors at diagnosis and during therapy, and furnishes support for FLT3-ITD as a clinically relevant biomarker for dynamic disease risk assessment in AML.

        "AbstractText": "South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) nations are a group of eight countries with low to medium Human Development Index values. They lack trained human resources in primary health care to achieve the WHO-stated goal of Universal Health Coverage. An unregulated service sector of informal health care providers (IPs) has been serving these underserved communities. The aim is to summarize the role of IPs in primary cancer care, compare quality with formal providers, quantify distribution in urban and rural settings, and present the socioeconomic milieu that sustains their existence. A narrative review of the published literature in English from January 2000 to December 2021 was performed using MeSH Terms Informal Health Care Provider/Informal Provider and Primary Health Care across databases such as Medline (PubMed), Google Scholar, and Cochrane database of systematic reviews, as well as World Bank, Center for Global Development, American Economic Review, Journal Storage, and Web of Science. In addition, citation lists from the primary articles, gray literature in English, and policy blogs were included. We present a descriptive overview of our findings as applicable to SAARC. IPs across the rural landscape often comprise more than 75% of primary caregivers. They provide accessible and affordable, but often substandard quality of care. However, their network would be suitable for prompt cancer referrals. Care delivery and accountability correlate with prevalent standards of formal health care. Acknowledgment and upskilling of IPs could be a cost-effective bridge toward universal health coverage and early cancer diagnosis in SAARC nations, whereas state capacity for training formal health care providers is ramped up simultaneously. This must be achieved without compromising investment in the critical resource of qualified doctors and allied health professionals who form the core of the rural public primary health care system.

However, they are costly, and it is unclear whether these strategies, alone or combined, are cost-effective over SOC. A Markov model was constructed to compare four strategies for patients with newly diagnosed intermediate- to high-risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: strategy 1: polatuzumab-rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (R-CHP) plus second-line CAR-T for early relapse (< 12 months); strategy 2: polatuzumab-R-CHP plus second-line salvage therapy &#177; autologous stem-cell transplant; strategy 3: rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone plus second-line CAR-T for early relapse; strategy 4: SOC (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone plus second-line salvage therapy &#177; autologous stem-cell transplant). Transition probabilities were estimated from trial data. Lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated from US and Canadian payer perspectives. Willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of $150,000 US dollars (USD) or Canadian dollars (CAD)/QALY were used. In probabilistic analyses (10,000 simulations), each strategy was incrementally more effective than the previous strategy, but also more costly. Adding polatuzumab-R-CHP to the SOC had an ICER of $546,956 (338,797-1,199,923) USD/QALY and $245,381 (151,671-573,250) CAD/QALY. Adding second-line CAR-T to the SOC had an ICER of $309,813 (190,197-694,200) USD/QALY and $303,163 (221,300-1,063,864) CAD/QALY. Simultaneously adding both polatuzumab-R-CHP and second-line CAR-T to the SOC had an ICER of $488,284 (326,765-840,157) USD/QALY and $267,050 (182,832-520,922) CAD/QALY. Given uncertain incremental benefits in long-term survival and high costs, neither polatuzumab-R-CHP frontline, CAR-T second-line, nor a combination are likely to be cost-effective in the United States or Canada at current pricing compared with the SOC.

        "AbstractText": "Primary plasma cell leukemia (PCL) is the most aggressive monoclonal gammopathy. It was formerly characterized by &#8805; 20% circulating plasma cells (CTCs) until 2021, when this threshold was decreased to &#8805; 5%. We hypothesized that primary PCL is not a separate clinical entity, but rather that it represents ultra-high-risk multiple myeloma (MM) characterized by elevated CTC levels. We assessed the levels of CTCs by multiparameter flow cytometry in 395 patients with newly diagnosed transplant-ineligible MM to establish a cutoff for CTCs that identifies the patients with ultra-high-risk PCL-like MM. We tested the cutoff on 185 transplant-eligible patients with MM and further validated on an independent cohort of 280 transplant-ineligible patients treated in the GEM-CLARIDEX trial. The largest published real-world cohort of patients with primary PCL was used for comparison of survival. Finally, we challenged the current 5% threshold for primary PCL diagnosis. Newly diagnosed transplant-ineligible patients with MM with 2%-20% CTCs had significantly shorter progression-free survival (3.1 v 15.6 months; P < .001) and overall survival (14.6 v 33.6 months; P = .023) than patients with < 2%. The 2% cutoff proved to be applicable also in transplant-eligible patients with MM and was successfully validated on an independent cohort of patients from the GEM-CLARIDEX trial. Most importantly, patients with 2%-20% CTCs had comparable dismal outcomes with primary PCL. Moreover, after revealing a low mean difference between flow cytometric and morphologic evaluation of CTCs, we showed that patients with 2%-5% CTCs have similar outcomes as those with 5%-20% CTCs. Our study uncovers that &#8805; 2% CTCs is a biomarker of hidden primary PCL and supports the assessment of CTCs by flow cytometry during the diagnostic workup of MM. ",

The ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) gene on chromosome 11 has more than 1,000 germline missense variants of unknown significance and is a tumor suppressor. We aimed to determine if rare germline ATM variants are more frequent in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) compared with other hematologic malignancies and if they influence the clinical characteristics of CLL. We identified 3,128 patients (including 825 patients with CLL) in our hematologic malignancy clinic who had received clinical-grade sequencing of the entire coding region of ATM. We ascertained the comparative frequencies of germline ATM variants in categories of hematologic neoplasms, and, in patients with CLL, we determined whether these variants affected CLL-associated characteristics such as somatic 11q deletion. Rare germline ATM variants are present in 24% of patients with CLL, significantly greater than that in patients with other lymphoid malignancies (16% prevalence), myeloid disease (15%), or no hematologic neoplasm (14%). Patients with CLL with germline ATM variants are younger at diagnosis and twice as likely to have 11q deletion. The ATM variant p.L2307F is present in 3% of patients with CLL, is associated with a three-fold increase in rates of somatic 11q deletion, and is a hypomorph in cell-based assays. Germline ATM variants cluster within CLL and affect the phenotype of CLL that develops, implying that some of these variants (such as ATM p.L2307F) have functional significance and should not be ignored. Further studies are needed to determine whether these variants affect the response to therapy or account for some of the inherited risk of CLL. ",

        "AbstractText": "The TAPUR Study is a pragmatic phase II basket trial evaluating antitumor activity of commercially available targeted agents in patients with advanced cancers harboring potentially actionable genomic alterations. Data from two cohorts of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) with either ERBB2 amplifications or ERBB2 or ERBB3 (ERBB2/3) mutations treated with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab (P + T) are reported. Eligible patients with measurable CRC were selected for treatment with P + T according to protocol-specified genomic matching rules. Patients had no remaining standard treatment options, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2, and adequate organ function. Simon's two-stage design was used with a primary study end point of disease control (DC; objective response [OR] or stable disease of at least 16 weeks duration [SD16+]). Secondary end points include safety, response duration, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Thirty-eight patients with CRC with ERBB2 amplification (N = 28) or ERBB2/3 mutations (N = 10) were treated with P + T. For the ERBB2 amplification cohort, DC and OR were observed in 54% and 25% of patients, respectively; the median PFS and median OS (95% CIs) were 17.2 (11.1 to 27.4) weeks and 60.0 (32.1 to 102.3) weeks, respectively. For the ERBB2/3 mutation cohort, DC and OR were observed in 10% and 0% of patients, respectively; the median PFS and median OS were 9.6 (5.1 to 16.0) weeks and 28.8 (7.6 to 146.3) weeks, respectively. Four of 38 patients experienced grade 3 adverse events or serious adverse events including anemia, infusion reaction, diarrhea, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and decreased lymphocyte count. Although P + T treatment does not appear to have antitumor activity in CRC with ERBB2/3 mutations, this combination has antitumor activity in patients with CRC with ERBB2 amplification and warrants further study.

This study aims to characterize the clinical impact of matching targetable genomic alterations (GAs) in patients with advanced cancer according to ESCAT. Analysis of next-generation sequencing results from 552 patients is included in two prospective precision medicine studies at Gustave Roussy. End points included objective response rates, progression-free survival, and overall survival according to ESCAT. Molecular data from 516 patients were available and discussed within a Molecular Tumor Board. The most common tumor types were GI (n = 164; 30%), lung (n = 137; 25%), and urologic tumors (n = 68; 13%). Overall, 379 GAs were considered as actionable targets according to ESCAT in 348 (67%) patients. In 31 (6%) patients, two concomitant actionable targets were identified. On the basis of ESCAT, GAs were considered to be classified as tier I in 120 patients (29%), II in 25 patients (5%), III in 80 patients (16%), and IV in 153 patients (30%). A total of 136 patients (27%) received a matched therapy. ESCAT was significantly associated with objective response rates and clinical benefit rates. The median progression-free survival was 6.5 months (95% CI, 4.2 to 8.9), 3 months (95% CI, 1 to not available), 3 months (95% CI, 2.2 to 3.8), and 4 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 6.3) for ESCAT I, II, III, and IV, respectively (P = .0125).

        "AbstractText": "Personalized medicine presents new opportunities for patients with cancer. However, many patients do not receive the most effective personalized treatments because of challenges associated with integrating predictive biomarker testing into clinical care. Patients are lost at various steps along the precision oncology pathway because of operational inefficiencies, limited understanding of biomarker strategies, inappropriate testing result usage, and access barriers. We examine the impact of various clinical practice gaps associated with diagnostic testing-informed personalized medicine strategies on the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (aNSCLC). Using Diaceutics' Data Repository, a multisource database including commercial and Medicare claims and laboratory data from over 500,000 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer in the United States, we analyzed the number of patients with newly diagnosed aNSCLC who could have, but did not, benefit from a personalized treatment. The analysis focuses on the independent and cumulative impacts of gaps occurring during seven steps of the precision oncology pathway, from diagnosis to treatment. For every 1,000 patients in the study cohort, 497 (49.7%) are lost to precision oncology because of factors associated with getting biomarker test results. Among the 503 of 1,000 patients who did receive results from a biomarker test, 147 (29.2%) did not receive appropriate targeted treatments. Thus, approximately 64% of potentially eligible patients with aNSCLC are not benefiting from precision oncology therapies appropriate for their disease. Most patients with aNSCLC eligible for precision oncology treatments do not benefit from them because of clinical practice gaps. This finding is likely reflective of similar gaps in other cancer types. An increased understanding of the impact of each practice gap can inform strategies to improve the delivery of precision oncology, helping to fully realize the promise of personalized medicine. ",

However, its role in maintaining established leukemia stem cells remains largely unknown. To identify functionally relevant protein interactions of -Catenin in T-ALL, we performed co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) followed by liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry. Here, we report that a non-canonical functional interaction of &#946;-Catenin with the Forkhead-Box-O3 (FOXO3) transcription factor positively regulates LIC related genes including the Cyclin-dependent-kinase-4 (CDK4), which is a crucial modulator of cell cycle and tumor maintenance. We also confirm the relevance of these findings using stably integrated fluorescent reporters of &#946;-Catenin and FOXO3 activity in patient-derived xenografts, which identify minor subpopulations with enriched LIC activity. Additionally, gene expression data at the single-cell level of leukemic cells of primary patients at the diagnosis and minimal residual disease (MRD) up to 30 days from the standard treatments reveal that the expression of &#946;-Catenin and FOXO3 dependent genes is present in the CD82+CD117+ cell fraction, which is substantially enriched with LICs in MRD as well as in early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL).

Iron-restricted erythropoiesis is a common cause of anemia severe enough to be considered for red blood cell transfusion but diagnosis and management of absolute iron deficiency anemia, the anemia of inflammation with functional iron deficiency, or their combination may be problematic.

In the present study, we aimed to establish a potential relationship between JAK/STAT3 signaling activation and clinicopathologic features in ALK- ALCLs, and further recognize the heterogenous nature of these neoplasms. Immunohistochemistry staining of the phosphorylated-STAT3 (p-STAT3) and dual-specificity protein phosphatase 22 (DUSP22) gene rearrangement analysis were performed. Forty-five cases of ALK- ALCL were divided into 3 groups, including 9 DUSP22-rearranged ALCLs, 21 p-STAT3+ double-negative (DN) ALCLs (both ALK and DUSP22 rearrangement negative), and 15 p-STAT3- DN-ALCLs. Morphologically, p-STAT3+ DN-ALCLs exhibited sheet-like neoplastic cells and sometimes showed large pleomorphic cells scattered in a lymphocyte-rich background more frequently than those in other ALK- ALCLs subtypes. Phenotypically, the p-STAT3+ DN-ALCLs frequently expressed cytotoxic molecules, epithelial membrane antigen, and programmed death-ligand 1, whereas CD3 and CD5 expression was not observed. Clinically, patients with p-STAT3+ DN-ALCLs had a better prognosis than those with p-STAT3- DN-ALCLs. These observations suggest that p-STAT3+ DN-ALCLs represent a distinct subtype of ALK- ALCLs.

GBM is associated with an abnormal mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, consisting of two distinct kinase complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. The complexes play critical roles in cell proliferation, survival, migration, metabolism, and DNA damage response. This study investigated the aberrant mTORC2 signaling pathway in GBM cells by performing quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of U87MG cells under different drug treatment conditions. Interestingly, a functional analysis of phosphoproteome revealed that mTORC2 inhibition might be involved in double-strand break (DSB) repair. We further characterized the relationship between mTORC2 and BRISC and BRCA1-A complex member 1 (BABAM1). We demonstrated that pBABAM1 at Ser29 is regulated by mTORC2 to initiate DNA damage response, contributing to DNA repair and cancer cell survival. Accordingly, the inactivation of mTORC2 significantly ablated pBABAM1 (Ser29), reduced DNA repair activities in the nucleus, and promoted apoptosis of the cancer cells. Furthermore, we also recognized that histone H2AX phosphorylation at Ser139 (&#947;H2AX) could be controlled by mTORC2 to repair the DNA. These results provided a better understanding of the mTORC2 function in oncogenic DNA damage response and might lead to specific mTORC2 treatments for brain cancer patients in the future. ",

Translational profiling revealed only a small overlap between Mnk1/2- and phospho-eIF4E(Ser209)-regulated translatome. We identified the synaptic Ras GTPase activating protein 1 (Syngap1), encoded by a syndromic autism gene, as a downstream target of Mnk1 since Syngap1 immunoprecipitated with Mnk1 and showed reduced phosphorylation (S788) in Mnk DKO mice. Knock-down of Syngap1 reversed memory deficits in Mnk DKO mice, and pharmacological inhibition of Mnks rescued autism-related phenotypes in Syngap1+/- mice. Thus, Syngap1 is a downstream effector of Mnk1, and the Mnks-Syngap1 axis regulates memory formation and autism-related behaviours. ",

        "ArticleTitle": "Translational buffering by ribosome stalling in upstream open reading frames. ",
        "AbstractText": "Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are present in over half of all human mRNAs. uORFs can potently regulate the translation of downstream open reading frames through several mechanisms: siphoning away scanning ribosomes, regulating re-initiation, and allowing interactions between scanning and elongating ribosomes. However, the consequences of these different mechanisms for the regulation of protein expression remain incompletely understood. Here, we performed systematic measurements on the uORF-containing 5' UTR of the cytomegaloviral UL4 mRNA to test alternative models of uORF-mediated regulation in human cells. We find that a terminal diproline-dependent elongating ribosome stall in the UL4 uORF prevents decreases in main ORF protein expression when ribosome loading onto the mRNA is reduced. This uORF-mediated buffering is insensitive to the location of the ribosome stall along the uORF. Computational kinetic modeling based on our measurements suggests that scanning ribosomes dissociate rather than queue when they collide with stalled elongating ribosomes within the UL4 uORF. We identify several human uORFs that repress main ORF protein expression via a similar terminal diproline motif. We propose that ribosome stalls in uORFs provide a general mechanism for buffering against reductions in main ORF translation during stress and developmental transitions. ",

        "AbstractText": "Prophylactic transarterial chemoembolization (p-TACE) is frequently conducted for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in China, but the question of who could benefit from it remains controversial. Hence, we wanted to establish a nomogram model to identify patients eligible for p-TACE. Data from HCC patients receiving R0 resection with or without p-TACE between January 2013 and December 2014 were identified, using primary liver cancer big data, to establish a nomogram model to predict overall survival (OS). Based on the model, Patients receiving R0 resection between January 2015 and December 2015 were divided into three subgroups, and survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed by the log-rank test among patients in each subgroup. A nomogram integrating the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, AFP, tumor diameter, and microvascular invasion was developed to predict the OS of patients with HCC receiving R0 resection, and significant differences were observed in the median OS of the subgroups of low-risk (&#8804;20), intermediate-risk (20~120), and high-risk (>120) identified by the current model. This model showed good calibration and discriminatory power in the validation cohort and the external cohort (c-index of 0.669 and 0.676, respectively). In the external cohort, the Kaplan-Meier curves showed that p-TACE could only significantly prolong the median OS of high-risk patients (25.6 vs. 33.7 months, P<0.05), but no differences were observed in any subgroups stratified by the current staging systems (all P>0.05). This readily available nomogram model could help guide decisions about p-TACE, but it needs further validation. ",

        "AbstractText": "Expanded implementation of genetic sequencing has precipitously increased the discovery of germline and somatic variants. The direct benefit of identifying variants in actionable genes may lead to risk reduction strategies such as increased surveillance, prophylactic surgery, as well as lifestyle modifications to reduce morbidity and mortality. However, patients with African ancestry are more likely to receive inconclusive genetic testing results due to an increased number of variants of unknown significance decreasing the utility and impact on disease management and prevention. This study examines whole exome sequencing results from germline DNA samples in African American women with a family history of cancer including 37 cases that were diagnosed with breast cancer and 51 family members. Self-identified ancestry was validated and compared to the 1000 genomes population. The analysis of sequencing results was limited to 85 genes from three clinically available common genetic screening platforms. This target region had a total of 993 variants of which 6 (<1%) were pathogenic or likely pathogenic, 736 (74.1%) were benign, and 170 (17.1%) were classified as a variant of unknown significance. There was an average of 3.4&#177;1.8 variants with an unknown significance per individual and 85 of 88 individuals (96.6%) harbored at least one of these in the targeted genes. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were only found in 6 individuals for the BRCA1 (p.R1726fs, rs80357867), BRCA2 (p.K589fs, rs397507606 & p.L2805fs, rs397507402), RAD50 (p.E995fs, rs587780154), ATM (p.V2424G, rs28904921), or MUTYH (p.G396D, rs36053993) genes. Strategies to functionally validate the remaining variants of unknown significance, especially in understudied and hereditary cancer populations, are greatly needed to increase the clinical utility and utilization of clinical genetic screening platforms to reduce cancer incidence and mortality.

        "AbstractText": "Skin cancer is considered to be the most common human malignancy. Around 5 million new cases of skin cancer are recorded in the United States annually. Early identification and evaluation of skin lesions are of great clinical significance, but the disproportionate dermatologist-patient ratio poses a significant problem in most developing nations. Therefore a novel deep architecture, named as SkiNet, is proposed to provide faster screening solution and assistance to newly trained physicians in the process of clinical diagnosis of skin cancer. The main motive behind SkiNet's design and development is to provide a white box solution, addressing a critical problem of trust and interpretability which is crucial for the wider adoption of Computer-aided diagnosis systems by medical practitioners. The proposed SkiNet is a two-stage pipeline wherein the lesion segmentation is followed by the lesion classification. Monte Carlo dropout and test time augmentation techniques have been employed in the proposed method to estimate epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. A novel segmentation model named Bayesian MultiResUNet is used to estimate the uncertainty on the predicted segmentation map. Saliency-based methods like XRAI, Grad-CAM and Guided Backprop are explored to provide post-hoc explanations of the deep learning models. The ISIC-2018 dataset is used to perform the experimentation and ablation studies. The results establish the robustness of the proposed model on the traditional benchmarks while addressing the black-box nature of such models to alleviate the skepticism of medical practitioners by incorporating transparency and confidence to the model's prediction.

        "AbstractText": "Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) techniques, currently considered the gold standard in the treatment of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), are mainly represented by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), both uniportal and multiportal, and by robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS). While multiportal RATS has been accepted as a valid alternative to VATS, carrying the advantages of three-dimensional high-definition visualization and improved maneuverability, very few reports exist in literature on the application of uniportal RATS (U-RATS). Therefore, we describe our initial experience with this recently developed method in the treatment of early-stage NSCLC. U-RATS was conducted through a single 4 cm long antero-lateral mini-thoracotomy (AMLT) in the 6th intercostal space at the mid-axillary line. Three 8 mm robotic trocars were positioned and connected, from back to front, to robotic arms as follows: 30&#176; camera arm, robotic arm 2 (bipolar fenestrated grasper) and 1 (Maryland bipolar forceps). Assistant access was identified as the most anterior part of AMLT. Case 1: an 82-year-old woman (ASA III) underwent a left S6 segmentectomy for a clinical stage IA2 NSCLC, complicated by an air leak that resolved spontaneously by PO Day 3. Case 2: a 75-year-old man (ASA III) underwent an uncomplicated right lower lobectomy for a clinical stage IA3 NSCLC. Case 1 and 2 were discharged on PO Day 5 and 4, respectively. From what emerged in our small series, U-RATS with the Da Vinci Xi surgical system might be considered a safe, reliable, and effective alternative to other MIS techniques. Larger prospective studies are required to validate these findings. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. ",

At the primary tumor site, tumor cells could take on mesenchymal properties, termed the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This process is partly regulated by members of the cadherin (CDH) family of genes, and it is an essential step in the formation of metastases. There has been a lot of study of the roles of some of the CDH family genes in cancer; however, a holistic approach examining the roles of distinct CDH family genes in the development of breast cancer remains largely unexplored. In the present study, we used a bioinformatics approach to examine expression profiles of CDH family genes using the Oncomine, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2 (GEPIA2), cBioPortal, MetaCore, and Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource (TIMER) platforms. We revealed that CDH1/2/4/11/12/13 messenger (m)RNA levels are overexpressed in breast cancer cells compared to normal cells and were correlated with poor prognoses in breast cancer patients' distant metastasis-free survival. An enrichment analysis showed that high expressions of CDH1/2/4/11/12/13 were significantly correlated with cell adhesion, the extracellular matrix remodeling process, the EMT, WNT/beta-catenin, and interleukin-mediated immune responses. Collectively, CDH1/2/4/11/12/13 are thought to be potential biomarkers for breast cancer progression and metastasis. ",

Little is known about high intratumour heterogeneities in patients stratified by the Revised International Staging System (R-ISS). Herein, we constructed a single-cell transcriptome atlas to compare differential expression patterns among stages. We found that a novel cytotoxic plasma cell (PC) population exhibited with NKG7 positive was obviously enriched in stage II patients. Additionally, a malignant plasma cell population with significantly elevated expression of MKI67 and PCNA was associated with unfavourable prognosis and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in our collected samples. Moreover, Ribonucleotide Reductase Regulatory Subunit M2 (RRM2) was found and verified to promote proliferation of MM cell lines, suggesting RRM2 may serve as a detrimental marker in MM. The percentages of CD8+ T cells and NKT cells decreased along with R-ISS stages, reflecting the plasticity of the tumour immune microenvironment. Importantly, their crosstalks with myeloid cells and PC identified several potential immunotargets such as SIRPA-CD47, and CD74-MIF, respectively.

There is a great clinical need to realize the ultrasensitive detection of gene biomarkers in ctDNA. Here we reported that an ultrasensitive label-free biosensor was developed for the detection of the gastric cancer-related PIK3CA gene of ctDNA in peripheral blood. The polymeric l-arginine and graphene oxide-wrapped gold nanostars (rGO-AuNSs) were prepared and deposited on the glass electrode. The capturing DNA probes for the PIK3CA gene were prepared and successfully immobilized on the rGO-AuNS-modified electrode surface via &#960;-&#960; interaction among the rGO-AuNS composites and DNA probes. The resultant electrochemical sensor was effectively applied to detect the PIK3CA gene of ctDNA via the hybridization between the capturing DNA probe and ctDNA, the result of which showed that the biosensor exhibited desirable sensitivity, stability, and a wider dynamic response in a ctDNA concentration range from 1.0 &#215; 10-20 to 1.0 &#215; 10-10 M (R2 = 0.997). Moreover, the low limit of detection of 1.0 &#215; 10-20 M (S/N = 3) indicates the biosensor owns satisfactory detection sensitivity. Fourteen PIK3CA genes and two PIK3CA gene mutations were detected in 60 clinical ctDNA samples of gastric cancer patients by using the developed biosensor. In conclusion, this ultrasensitive label-free electrochemical biosensor possesses a significant application prospect in the detection of the PIK3CA gene in ctDNA and in early screening for gastric cancer in the near future.

The results showed that among all studied alpha-emitting radionuclides, 225 Ac, 223 Ra and 227 Th provide equidistantly the highest self-irradiation S-Factors whereas, 211At provides the lowest cross-irradiation S-Factors. On the other hand, considering only beta-emitting radionuclides, it is shown that 177Lu and 90Y induce respectively lowest and highest cross-absorption S-Factors on the surrounding healthy organs. We conclude that 177Lu and 211At are more adequate for prostate radionuclide therapy because they can relatively prevent surrounding organs from radiation toxicity and at the same time provide sufficient dose to treat the prostate tumor.

By binding irreversibly to KRASG12C, sotorasib inhibits downstream signalling pathways which are associated with cell growth and differentiation. Sotorasib is indicated for the treatment of adults with advanced, previously treated, KRAS G12C mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in multiple countries, including the countries of the EU and the USA. A clinically relevant objective response rate was observed in patients with KRAS G12C mutation-positive NSCLC during the primary analysis and in an updated analysis of the phase I/II CodeBreaK 100 trial. Furthermore, a clinically relevant response duration was reported in updated analyses of the trial. Sotorasib has a manageable tolerability profile, with permitted dose modifications to manage toxicity. In summary, sotorasib is a promising KRASG12C inhibitor that increases the available treatment options for patients with KRAS G12C mutation-positive NSCLC who were previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. KRAS is a protein that is involved in cell signalling pathways, including those that are associated with cell growth and differentiation. KRAS mutations are detected in 23% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with the G12C mutation being the most common. G12C-mutant KRAS (KRASG12C) is kept in an activated state, which is associated with cancer. Sotorasib (LUMAKRAS&#8482; in the USA and LUMYKRAS&#8482; in the EU), which is taken orally once daily, is the first approved drug that inhibits KRASG12C; it permanently binds to KRASG12C and locks it in an inactivated state. Sotorasib is approved for adults who have advanced, previously treated, KRAS G12C mutation-positive NSCLC. In a clinical trial in patients with KRAS G12C mutation-positive NSCLC, a clinically relevant proportion of patients responded to sotorasib treatment. Furthermore, the duration of effectiveness with sotorasib was considered to be clinically relevant. Adverse reactions with sotorasib treatment were manageable; the dose may be decreased and/or sotorasib treatment may be temporarily stopped to manage adverse reactions.

Fresh frozen sectioning (FFS) of tissue margins is the standard of care for intraoperative margin assessment. However, FFS is time intensive, and its accuracy is not consistent among institutes. Mapping the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) using paired-agent imaging (PAI) has the potential to provide more consistent intraoperative margin assessment in a fraction of the time as FFS. PAI was carried out through IV injection of an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) affibody molecule (ABY-029, eIND 122,681) and an untargeted IRDye680LT carboxylate. Imaging was performed on 4 &#181;m frozen sections from three oral squamous cell carcinoma xenograft mouse models (n&#8201;=&#8201;24, 8 samples per cell line). The diagnostic ability and tumor contrast were compared between binding potential, targeted, and untargeted images. Confidence maps were constructed based on group histogram-derived tumor probability curves. Tumor differentiability and contrast by confidence maps were evaluated. PAI outperformed ABY-029 and IRDye 680LT alone, demonstrating the highest individual receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area under the curve (PAI AUC: 0.91, 0.90, and 0.79) and contrast-to-noise ratio (PAI CNR: 1, 1.1, and 0.6) for FaDu, Det 562, and A253. PAI confidence maps (PAI CM) maintain high tumor diagnostic ability (PAI CMAUC: 0.91, 0.90, and 0.79) while significantly enhancing tumor contrast (PAI CMCNR: 1.5, 1.3, and 0.8) in FaDu, Det 562, and A253. Additionally, the PAI confidence map allows avascular A253 to be differentiated from a healthy tissue with significantly higher contrast than PAI. Notably, PAI does not require additional staining and therefore significantly reduces the tumor delineation time in a 5 [Formula: see text] 5&#160;mm slice from&#8201;~&#8201;35&#160;min to under a minute. This study demonstrated that PAI improved tumor detection in frozen sections with high diagnostic accuracy and rapid analysis times. The novel PAI confidence map improved the contrast in vascular tumors and differentiability in avascular tumors. With a larger database, the PAI confidence map promises to standardize fluorescence imaging in intraoperative pathology-assisted surgery (IPAS). ",

In this framework, tumour cells and T cells are modelled as individual agents while chemokines that drive the chemotactic movement of T cells towards the tumour are modelled as a continuum. We formally derive the continuum counterpart of this model, which is given by a coupled system that comprises an integro-differential equation for the density of tumour cells, a partial differential equation for the density of T cells and a partial differential equation for the concentration of chemokines. We report on computational results of the hybrid model and show that there is an excellent quantitative agreement between them and numerical solutions of the corresponding continuum model. These results shed light on the mechanisms that underlie the emergence of different levels of infiltration of T cells into the tumour and elucidate how T-cell infiltration shapes anti-tumour immune response. Moreover, to present a proof of concept for the idea that, exploiting the computational efficiency of the continuum model, extensive numerical simulations could be carried out, we investigate the impact of T-cell infiltration on the response of tumour cells to different types of anti-cancer immunotherapy.

There is a paucity for high-level evidence of non-surgical options for CPIP. Different treatment options and algorithms have been published for chronic pain patients in the last decades. It is suggested that non-surgical treatment is introduced in the management of all CPIP patients. The overall approach to interventions should be pragmatic, tiered and multi-interventional, starting with least invasive and only moving to more invasive procedures upon lack of effect. Evaluation should be multidisciplinary and should take place in specialized centres. We strongly suggest to follow general guidelines for treatment of persistent pain and to build a database allowing for establishing CPIP specific evidence for optimal analgesic treatments. ",

Randomized controlled trials have found that direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are associated with fewer recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) events and an increased risk of bleeding than low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) in CAT. With new clinical data available, this study aims to assess the comparative cost-effectiveness of DOACs and LMWHs over 6- and 60-month treatment durations from the US healthcare system and societal perspectives. A Markov model for cancer patients eligible to receive rivaroxaban, edoxaban, apixaban, enoxaparin, or dalteparin was used to conduct a cost-utility analysis. Clinical scenarios were analyzed based on 6- and 60-month time horizons from the US healthcare system and societal perspectives. The main outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as cost in US dollars per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the results. DOACs were cost-saving and clinically superior to LMWHs and were associated with a cost change ranging from -&#160;$9134.66 to -&#160;$15,281.92 and incremental effectiveness of 0.43-1.25 QALYs among four clinical scenarios. The most influential model inputs for ICER were the utility associated with LMWH use and probabilities of non-VTE and non-bleeding related death. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were consistent with the results. DOACs were found to dominate LMWHs, suggesting that DOACs may be a cost-effective alternative to LMWHs for CAT. This study can help inform decision-makers on the cost-effectiveness of anticoagulation strategies and help in the development of future practice recommendations for cancer patients. ",

        "AbstractText": "Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the most common type of esophageal cancer (EC) in Asia. It is a malignant digestive tract tumor with abundant gene mutations. Due to the lack of specific diagnostic markers and early cancer screening markers, most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Genetic and epigenetic changes are closely related to the occurrence and development of ESCC. Here, We review the activation of proto-oncogenes into oncogenes through gene mutation and gene amplification in ESCC from a genetic and epigenetic genome perspective, We also discuss the specific regulatory mechanisms through which these oncogenes mainly affect the biological function and occurrence and development of ESCC through specific regulatory mechanisms. In addition, we summarize the clinical application value of these oncogenes is summarized, and it provides a feasible direction for clinical use as potential therapeutic and diagnostic markers. ",

        "AbstractText": "Germline DNA alterations affecting homologous recombination pathway genes have been associated with pancreatic cancer (PC) risk. BRCA2 is the most studied gene and affects the management of PC patients and their families. Even though recent reports have suggested a similar role of germline ATM pathogenic variants (PV) in familial PC, there is still a disagreement between experts on how it could affect patient management given the lack of proper PC risk estimates. We retrospectively analyzed the germline data of 257 PC patients among whom nearly 50% were sporadic cases. We showed similar frequencies of BRCA2 (4.9%) and ATM (4.4%) PV or likely pathogenic variants, which were not related to familial history. Based on our findings and that of the literature, we suggest including ATM gene among the panel of genes analyzed in PC patients pending the publication of prospective studies. ",

The pooled hazard ratio (HR) and relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated by the fixed/random effects model. Overall, 6 randomized controlled trials including 1938 patients were included. The complete response rate (CRR) of the group containing lenalidomide was 47.7% (95%CI 28.5-67.2%), which was higher than the 37.8% (95%CI 16.7-61.5%) of the control group without lenalidomide (RR&#8201;=&#8201;1.11, 95%CI 1.03-1.20, P&#8201;=&#8201;0.008).

Eight prospective studies and one retrospective study including 784 patients with localized NSCLC were used in our meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of ctDNA for minimal residual disease (MRD) detection were 0.58 and 0.93, respectively.

In this study we compared the severity of locoregional recurrences (LRRs) and the subsequent risk of a distant metastasis (DM) between LRRs detected at routine and interval visits. Women diagnosed with early breast cancer between 2003 and 2008 in one of the 15 participating hospitals, and who developed a LRR as first event after primary treatment, were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry (Cohort A). Chi-squared tests were used to compare the severity of routine- and interval-detected local recurrences (LRs) and regional recurrences (RRs), using tumor size, tumor grade, and number of positive lymph nodes. Data on the development of a subsequent DM after a LRR were available for a subset of patients (Cohort B). Cohort B was used to estimate the association between way of LRR-detection and risk of a DM. Cohort A consisted of 109 routine- and 113 interval-LRR patients. The severity of routine-detected LRs or RRs and interval-detected LRs or RRs did not significantly differ. Cohort B consisted of 66 routine- and 61 interval-LRR patients. Sixteen routine- (24%) and 17 (28%) interval-LRR patients developed a DM. After adjustment, way of LRR-detection was not significantly associated with the risk of a DM (hazard ratio: 1.22; 95% confidence interval: 0.49-3.06). The current study showed that routine visits did not lead to less severe LRRs and did not decrease the risk of a subsequent DM. ",

        "AbstractText": "Patients presenting with metastatic hepatoblastoma have limited treatment options and survival rates as low as 25%. We previously demonstrated that Proviral Integration site in Maloney murine leukemia virus 3 (PIM3) kinase promotes tumorigenesis and cancer cell stemness in hepatoblastoma. In this study, we assessed the role of PIM3 kinase in promoting hepatoblastoma metastasis. We utilized a tail vein injection model of metastasis to evaluate the effect of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated PIM3 knockout, stable overexpression of PIM3, and pharmacologic PIM inhibition on the formation of lung metastasis. In vivo studies revealed PIM3 knockout impaired the formation of lung metastasis: 5 out of 6 mice injected with wild type hepatoblastoma cells developed lung metastasis while none of the 7 mice injected with PIM3 knockout hepatoblastoma cells developed lung metastasis. PIM3 overexpression in hepatoblastoma increased the pulmonary metastatic burden in mice and mechanistically, upregulated the phosphorylation and cell surface expression of CXCR4, a key receptor in the progression of cancer cell metastasis. CXCR4 blockade with AMD3100 decreased the metastatic phenotype of PIM3 overexpressing cells, indicating that CXCR4 contributed to PIM3's promotion of hepatoblastoma metastasis. Clinically, PIM3 expression correlated positively with CXCR4 expression in primary hepatoblastoma tissues. In conclusion, we have shown PIM3 kinase promotes the metastatic phenotype of hepatoblastoma cells through upregulation of CXCR4 cell surface expression and these findings suggest that targeting PIM3 kinase may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for metastatic hepatoblastoma.

        "AbstractText": "Hyperparathyroidism is a common endocrine disorder characterized by elevated levels of parathyroid hormone and hypercalcemia and is divided into 3 types: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Distinction between these types is accomplished by correlation of clinical, radiologic, and laboratory findings with pathologic features. Primary hyperparathyroidism occurs sporadically in 85% of cases with the remaining cases associated with multiple familial syndromes. The pathologic manifestations of primary hyperparathyroidism include parathyroid adenoma, parathyroid hyperplasia, and parathyroid carcinoma. Recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of parathyroid disease has helped to refine the diagnosis and classification of parathyroid lesions. The identification of multiple clonal proliferations in traditional multiglandular parathyroid hyperplasia has led to the adoption by the World Health Organization (WHO) of the alternate term of primary hyperparathyroidism-related multiglandular parathyroid disease. Additional nomenclature changes include the adoption of the term atypical parathyroid tumor in lieu of atypical parathyroid adenoma to reflect the uncertain malignant potential of these neoplasms. Clinical and morphologic features characteristic of familial disease have been described that can help the practicing pathologist identify underlying familial disease and provide appropriate management. Use of ancillary immunohistochemistry and molecular studies can be helpful in classifying parathyroid neoplasms. Parafibromin has proven useful as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in atypical parathyroid tumors and parathyroid carcinomas. This review provides an update on the diagnosis and classification of parathyroid lesions considering the recent advances in the understanding of the molecular and clinical features of parathyroid disease and highlights the use of ancillary studies (immunohistochemical, and molecular) to refine the diagnosis of parathyroid lesions.

A systematic review was conducted of interventional, prospective clinical trials describing LD practices prior to TCR-T cell therapy in patients with advanced solid tumours. The objective was to define LD regimens administered prior to TCR-T cell therapy and their effects on specific safety and efficacy outcomes in this patient population. Searches returned 484 studies, 19 (231 patients) met the eligibility criteria. Cyclophosphamide (cyclo) 60&#160;mg/kg daily (2&#160;days), plus fludarabine (fludara) 25&#160;mg/m2 daily (5&#160;days) was the most common LD regimen (38% of studies).

In this survey study, a novel 39-item questionnaire was distributed to US female oncologists from May 7 to June 30, 2020, via email and social media channels. Questions regarding factors associated with family planning, maternity leave, and discrimination were included. The distribution of survey responses was compared by oncology subspecialty. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine independent variables for discrimination experienced during maternity leave. Responses were collected from 1004 female oncologists. Most respondents (847 [84.4%]) were married, and 713 (71.0%) were currently working full-time.

This qualitative content analysis included clinical encounters between physicians and anticoagulation-naive patients discussing anticoagulation initiation between 2014 and 2020. Themes identified through content analysis. Of 37 encounters, almost all (34 [92%]) resulted in a prescription for a DOAC. Most (25 [68%]) patients were White; 15 (41%) were female and 22 (59%) were male; and 24 (65%) were aged 65 to 84 years. Twenty-one physicians conducted the included encounters, the majority of whom were cardiologists (14 [67%]) and male (19 [90%]). The analysis revealed 4 major categories and associated subcategories of themes associated with physician discussion of anticoagulation with anticoagulation-naive patients: (1) benefit vs risk of taking anticoagulation-in many cases, this involved an imbalance in completeness of discussion of stroke vs bleeding risk, and physicians often used emotional language; (2) tradeoffs between warfarin and DOACs-physicians typically discussed pros and cons, used persuasive language, and provided mixed signals, telling patients that warfarin and DOACs were basically equivalent, while simultaneously saying warfarin is rat poison; (3) medication costs-physicians often attempted to address patients' questions about out-of-pocket costs but were unable to provide concrete answers, and they often provided free samples or coupons; and (4) DOACs in television commercials-physicians used direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising about DOACs to orient patients to the issue of anticoagulation as well as the advantages of DOACs over warfarin. Patients and physicians also discussed class action lawsuits for DOACs that patients had seen on television. This qualitative analysis of anticoagulation discussions between physicians and patients during clinical encounters found that physicians engaged in persuasive communication to convince patients to accept anticoagulation with a DOAC, yet they were unable to address questions regarding medication costs. For patients who are ultimately unable to afford DOACs, this may lead to unnecessary financial burden or abandoning prescriptions at the pharmacy, placing them at continued risk of stroke. ",

This study was developed to describe and explore parents' experiences of a pretend play intervention that consisted of six to eight play sessions with a play facilitator administered to their children undergoing cancer treatment. A descriptive qualitative method was used, including individual interviews with 15 parents. Three main categories were developed, including (a) experiences of joining the project, (b) perceptions of the play intervention, and (c) reflections on effects and implications, with subcategories evolved for each category. The parents experienced that the play sessions helped improve their children's communication skills and made them more capable of participating in their care. They appreciated that the intervention focused on the child's well-being and saw it as a positive break in their child's cancer treatment. It also helped them better reflect on their own situation. According to the parents' experiences, pretend play can be a helpful tool for improving children's participation in their cancer care that strengthens their autonomy, emotional repertoire, and communication skills. However, the results also highlighted that some of the children did not fully understand the information provided about this study, which weakened the validity of their consent to participate. Thus, more work is needed on developing age-appropriate information to obtain participation consent from children. In addition, more knowledge is needed regarding how to appropriately include children with cancer in research in an ethically acceptable way. ",

        "AbstractText": "Gas generation-based immunoassay is considered an attractive biosensing platform for the detection of biomarkers by incorporating the target recognition event with a catalyzed gas-generating reaction. Herein, an optical gas pressure sensor based on a silver/polydimethylsiloxane (Ag/PDMS) bilayer system was designed as a signal transducer to read the concentration of the detection target alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) quantitatively. In this proposed pressure-based assay, silicon dioxide (SiO2) nanospheres decorated with platinum (Pt) nanoparticles were coupled to detect antibodies by covalent linkage, and the captured antibodies were conjugated with magnetic beads via streptavidin-biotin interaction, simultaneously. When the AFP was loaded, the Pt-catalyzed hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) decomposition reaction was triggered to induce a significant increase in the reflectance signal of the Ag/PDMS bilayer gas pressure sensor (BGPS) due to a \"wrinkled-specular\" transition of the Ag film's surface. Under optimal conditions, the pressure-based biosensor exhibited a broad linear detection range from 0.05 to 132 ng mL-1 with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.016 ng mL-1 for AFP, which satisfies the requirements for the clinical detection of AFP. Besides, the high specificity and detection accuracy of our Ag/PDMS BGPS also proved its feasibility for practical diagnosis. ",

Both manual and automated analyses alike are adversely impacted by bad quality data. There are several factors that can degrade image quality and, correspondingly, there are many approaches to mitigate their negative impact. In this paper, we address image quality control toward our goal of improving the performance of automated visual evaluation (AVE) for cervical precancer screening. Specifically, we report efforts made toward classifying images into four quality categories (\"unusable\", \"unsatisfactory\", \"limited\", and \"evaluable\") and improving the quality classification performance by automatically identifying mislabeled and overly ambiguous images. The proposed new deep learning ensemble framework is an integration of several networks that consists of three main components: cervix detection, mislabel identification, and quality classification. We evaluated our method using a large dataset that comprises 87,420 images obtained from 14,183 patients through several cervical cancer studies conducted by different providers using different imaging devices in different geographic regions worldwide. The proposed ensemble approach achieved higher performance than the baseline approaches. ",

        "AbstractText": "Despite great advances, the development of cancer drugs that can efficiently kill cancer cells while protecting noncancer cells has not been achieved. By using only dietary antioxidants vitamin C (VC) and (R)-(+)-lipoic acid (LA), we herein develop a nanodrug VC@cLAV featuring the above function. After entering cells, cLAV dissociates into LA and DHLA (dihydrolipoic acid, reduced form of LA) and releases VC and DHA (dehydroascorbate, oxidized form of VC). In cancer cells, the two redox pairs recycle each other and dramatically promote the intracellular reactive oxygen species production to kill cancer cells at low doses comparable to cytotoxic drugs. Oppositely in noncancer cells, the LA/DHLA and VC/DHA pairs exert anti-oxidant action to actively protect the organism by preventing the normal cells from oxidative stress and repairing cells suffering from oxidative stress. When compared with the first-line cytotoxic drug, VC@cLAV displayed superior therapeutic outcomes yet without side effects in diverse tumor models including patient-derived xenograft (PDX). This drug with efficient cancer cell killing and noncancer cell protection represents a new cancer therapy. ",

        "ArticleTitle": "RNA Polymerase II transcription attenuation at the yeast DNA repair gene DEF1 is biologically significant and dependent on the Hrp1 RNA-recognition motif. ",
        "AbstractText": "Premature transcription termination (i.e. attenuation) is a potent gene regulatory mechanism that represses mRNA synthesis. Attenuation of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) is more prevalent than once appreciated, targeting 10-15% of mRNA genes in yeast through higher eukaryotes, but its significance and mechanism remain obscure. In the yeast S. cerevisiae, Pol II attenuation was initially shown to rely on Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 termination, but more recently our lab characterized a hybrid termination pathway involving Hrp1, an RNA-binding protein in the 3'-end cleavage factor (CF). One of the hybrid attenuation gene targets is DEF1, which encodes a repair protein that promotes degradation of Pol II stalled at DNA lesions. In this study we characterized the chromosomal DEF1 attenuator and the functional role of Hrp1. DEF1 attenuator mutants overexpressed Def1 mRNA and protein, exacerbated Pol II degradation, and hindered cell growth, supporting a biologically significant DEF1 attenuator function. Using an auxin-induced Hrp1 depletion system, we identified new Hrp1-dependent attenuators in MNR2, SNG1, and RAD3 genes. An hrp1-5 mutant (L205S) known to impair binding to CF protein Rna14 also disrupted attenuation, but surprisingly no widespread defect was observed for an hrp1-1 mutant (K160E) located in the RNA recognition motif (RRM). We designed a new RRM mutant (hrp1-F162W) that altered a highly conserved residue and was lethal in single copy. In a heterozygous strain, hrp1-F162W exhibited dominant-negative read through defects at multiple gene attenuators. Overall our results expand the hybrid Pol II termination pathway, confirming that Hrp1-dependent attenuation controls multiple yeast genes and may function through binding CF proteins and/or RNA. ",

Tumour sequencing thus presents an orthogonal approach to assess the role of candidate genes in BC development. Exome sequencing was performed on paired normal-breast tumour DNA from 124 carriers of germline loss-of-function (LoF) or missense (MS) mutations carriers in 15 known and candidate BC predisposition genes identified in the BEACCON case-control study. Bi-allelic inactivation and association with tumour genome features including mutational signatures and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) score were investigated. BARD1-carrying TN BC (4/5) displayed bi-allelic loss and associated high HRD scores and mutational signature 3, as did a RAD51D-carrying TN BC and ovarian cancer. Bi-allelic loss was less frequent in BRIP1 BCs (4/13) and had low HRD scores. In contrast to other established BC genes, BCs from carriers of CHEK2 LoF (6/17) or MS (2/20) carriers had low rates of bi-allelic loss. Exploratory analysis of BC from carriers of LoF mutations in candidate genes such as BLM, FANCM, PARP2 and RAD50 found little evidence of bi-allelic inactivation. BARD1 and RAD51D behave as classic BRCA-like genes with bi-allelic inactivation but this was not observed for any of the candidate genes. However, as demonstrated for CHEK2, the absence of bi-allelic inactivation does not provide definitive evidence against the gene's involvement in BC predisposition. ",

The amount of erector spinae muscle has been reported to be related to the prognosis of several respiratory diseases. However, few studies clarify the impact on postoperative non-small cell lung cancer. We investigated the relationship between erector spinae muscle and postoperative prognosis in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. We reviewed the medical records of 534 patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer who underwent lobectomy or segmentectomy. The erector spinae muscle was identified by preoperative computed tomography, and the amount was normalized according to height and sex. Overall survival, lung cancer-related death, and non-lung cancer-related death were analyzed using log-rank and Gray's tests. Multivariable analyses were conducted to identify factors that influenced overall survival and non-lung cancer-related death. The amount of erector spinae muscle normalized according to height and sex was significantly associated with age and body mass index, and when the amount was low, overall survival (five-year overall survival, 79.6 vs 89.5%; P&#8201;<&#8201;0.001) and non-lung cancer-related death (five-year cumulative mortality rate, 14.7 vs 6.8%; P&#8201;<&#8201;0.001) were significantly worse, although no difference was found in lung cancer-related death. The amount of preoperative erector spinae muscle was strongly related to non-lung cancer-related death and was a significant prognostic factor for stage I non-small cell lung cancer.

        "AbstractText": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of breast cancer susceptibility have revealed risk-associated genetic variants and nominated candidate genes; however, the identification of causal variants and genes are often undetermined by GWAS. Comparative genomics, utilizing Rattus norvegicus strains differing in susceptibility to mammary tumor development, is a complimentary approach to identify breast cancer susceptibility genes. Mammary carcinoma susceptibility 3 (Mcs3) is a Copenhagen (COP/NHsd) allele that confers resistance to mammary carcinomas when introgressed into a mammary carcinoma susceptible Wistar Furth (WF/NHsd) genome. Here Mcs3 was positionally mapped to a 7.2&#8201;Mb region of RNO1 spanning rs8149408 to rs107402736 (Chr1:143700228-150929594, build 6.0/rn6) using WF.COP congenic strains and DMBA-induced mammary carcinogenesis. Male and female WF.COP-Mcs3 rats had significantly lower body mass compared to the WF strain. The effect on female body mass was observed only when females were raised in the absence of males indicating a socioenvironmental interaction. Furthermore, female WF.COP-Mcs3 rats, raised in the absence of males, did not develop enhanced lobuloalveolar morphologies compared to those observed in the WF strain. Human 15q25.1-25.2 was determined to be orthologous to rat Mcs3 (chr15:80005820-82285404 and chr15:83134545-84130720, build GRCh38/hg38). A public database search of 15q25.1-25.2 revealed genome-wide significant and nominally significant associations for body mass traits and breast cancer risk. These results support the existence of a breast cancer risk-associated allele at human 15q25.1-25.2 and warrant ultra-fine mapping of rat Mcs3 and human 15q25.1-25.2 to discover novel causal genes and variants.

        "AbstractText": "Fenton reaction-based chemodynamic therapy (CDT), which applies metal ions to convert less active hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into more harmful hydroxyl peroxide (&#183;OH) for tumor treatment, has attracted increasing interest recently. However, the CDT is substantially hindered by glutathione (GSH) scavenging effect on &#183;OH, low intracellular H2O2 level, and low reaction rate, resulting in unsatisfactory efficacy. Here, a cancer cell membrane (CM)-camouflaged Au nanorod core/mesoporous MnO2 shell yolk-shell nanocatalyst embedded with glucose oxidase (GOD) and Dox (denoted as AMGDC) is constructed for synergistic triple-augmented CDT and chemotherapy of tumor under MRI/PAI guidance. Benefiting from the homologous adhesion and immune escaping property of the cancer CM, the nanocatalysts can target tumor and gradually accumulate in tumor site. For triple-augmented CDT, first, the MnO2 shell reacts with intratumoral GSH to generate Mn2+ and glutathione disulfide, which achieves Fenton-like ion delivery and weakening of GSH-mediated scavenging effect, leading to GSH depletion-enhanced CDT. Second, the intratumoral glucose can be oxidized to H2O2 and gluconic acid by GOD, achieving supplementary H2O2-enhanced CDT. Next, the AuNRs absorbing in NIR-II elevate the local tumor temperature upon NIR-II laser irradiation, achieving photothermal-enhanced CDT. Dox is rapidly released for adjuvant chemotherapy due to responsive degradation of MnO2 shell. Moreover, GSH-activated PAI/MRI can be used to monitor CDT process. This study provides a great paradigm for enhancing CDT-mediated antitumor efficacy. ",

Immunohistochemistry was performed for CD14 on ccRCC and the corresponding adjacent non-cancer kidney tissue from 88 patients. Staining intensity was determined using Aperio ImageScope morphometry. Serum sCD14 was evaluated for 39 ccRCC patients and 38 non-cancer controls using ELISA. CD14 levels were compared with tumour characteristics and survival status.

Higher CD14 expression, in particular CD14 positive immune cell infiltrates found in the adjacent non-RCC kidney tissue, were associated with tumour progression and poorer prognosis. The levels of CD14 in non-RCC adjacent kidney and serum could be potential prognostic indicators.

While there is potential for differences in social functioning to vary as a function of geographic residence, few studies examine the social functioning of rural cancer survivors specifically. This study aims to help fill this gap. This was an embedded mixed-methods study where all participants completed a questionnaire, and some were purposively selected to complete an interview to gather more information about social functioning (ie, social roles, activities, network, support, and constraint). Participants (n = 93; 63% rural) were recruited through a state cancer registry and cancer care facility. Participants were predominately White, non-Hispanic (92.47%), roughly half female (54.84%), and on average, diagnosed in the past two years (SD = 1.68), and 61.45 (SD = 10.87) years old. Few differences in the social functioning of rural and nonrural participants were found on questionnaires, though rural participants reported larger networks and more overall support. Across groups, common themes in the interview data were the experience of both social support (eg, instrumental support) and social constraint (eg, others minimizing participants' problems or sharing their own negative experiences). This was the first cancer survivorship study to thoroughly examine social functioning by geographic residence. Rural cancer survivors described some unique strengths, but major group differences were not apparent. All participants highlighted situations when others, even with good intentions, were unhelpful to them. Future interventions to improve social functioning could work to dispel the belief that cancer survivors should handle their cancer on their own. ",

Using single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing, we traced the clonal expansion and differentiation of CD8+ T cells during chronic LCMV infection. We identified immense clonal and phenotypic diversity, including a subset termed intermediate cells. Trajectory analyses and infection models showed intermediate cells arise from progenitor cells before bifurcating into terminal effector and exhausted subsets. Genetic ablation experiments identified that type I IFN drives exhaustion through an IRF7-dependent mechanism, possibly through an IFN-stimulated subset bridging progenitor and exhausted cells. Conversely, Zeb2 was critical for generating effector cells. Intriguingly, some T cell clones exhibited lineage bias. Mechanistically, we identified that TCR avidity correlates with an exhausted fate, whereas SHP-1 selectively restricts low-avidity effector cell accumulation. Thus, our work elucidates novel mechanisms underlying CD8+ T cell fate determination during persistent infection and suggests two potential pathways leading to exhaustion. ",

Characterizing dynamic changes of T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire in peripheral blood and tumor tissue may facilitate developing markers for cetuximab response in HNSCCs. We analyzed high-throughput TCRb sequencing data generated with ImmunoSEQ platform using peripheral blood and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from HNSCC patients before and after cetuximab treatment (pre-/post-PBMC vs. pre-/post-TIL). Multiple analytic approaches were employed to normalize sequencing data. Normalized TCR richness was significantly lower in post-TIL than pre-TIL, suggesting that cetuximab reduced TCR diversity and promoted TCR expansion in TIL samples, regardless of response status. The magnitude of clonal expansion (defined as expansion rate) in top-20 TCR clonotypes was significantly higher in responder PBMC with or without normalization, and in responder TIL upon normalization, than non-responder ones. Notably, the expanded top-20 or top-50 TCR clonotypes overlapped between PBMC and TIL samples, which occurred significantly more frequently in responders than non-responders. Cetuximab-treated HNSCC patients harbor dynamic changes of TCR repertoires correlative to therapeutic responses. The expansion rate of top TCR clonotypes in peripheral blood may serve as a minimally invasive, readily accessible, and feasible marker for predicting cetuximab responses in HNSCCs and beyond, and the expansion rate of top TCR clonotypes in TILs and their overlapping probability between PBMC and TIL may serve as additional predictive markers.

        "AbstractText": "Three-dimensional (3D) multiecho balanced steady-state free precession (ME-bSSFP) has previously been demonstrated in preclinical hyperpolarized (HP) 13 C-MRI in vivo experiments, and it may be suitable for clinical metabolic imaging of prostate cancer (PCa). To validate a signal simulation framework for the use of sequence parameter optimization. To demonstrate the feasibility of ME-bSSFP for HP 13 C-MRI in patients. To evaluate the metabolism in PCa measured by ME-bSSFP. Retrospective single-center cohort study. Phantoms containing aqueous solutions of [1-13 C] lactate (2.3&#160;M) and [13 C] urea (8&#160;M). Eight patients (mean age 67&#8201;&#177;&#8201;6&#8201;years) with biopsy-confirmed Gleason 3&#8201;+&#8201;4 (n&#160;=&#160;7) and 4&#8201;+&#8201;3 (n&#160;=&#160;1) PCa. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCES: 1 H MRI at 3&#160;T with T2 -weighted turbo spin-echo sequence used for spatial localization and spoiled dual gradient-echo sequence used for B0 -field measurement. ME-bSSFP sequence for 13 C MR spectroscopic imaging with retrospective multipoint IDEAL metabolite separation. The primary endpoint was the analysis of pyruvate-to-lactate conversion in PCa and healthy prostate regions of interest (ROIs) using model-free area under the curve (AUC) ratios and a one-directional kinetic model (kP ). The secondary objectives were to investigate the correlation between simulated and experimental ME-bSSFP metabolite signals for HP 13 C-MRI parameter optimization. Pearson correlation coefficients with 95% confidence intervals and paired t-tests. The level of statistical significance was set at P&#8201;<&#8201;0.05. Strong correlations between simulated and empirical ME-bSSFP signals were found (r&#8201;>&#8201;0.96). Therefore, the simulation framework was used for sequence optimization. Whole prostate metabolic HP 13 C-MRI, observing the conversion of pyruvate into lactate, with a temporal resolution of 6&#160;seconds was demonstrated using ME-bSSFP. Both assessed metrics resulted in significant differences between PCa (mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;SD) (AUC&#160;=&#160;0.33&#8201;&#177;&#8201;012, kP &#160;=&#160;0.038&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.014) and healthy (AUC&#160;=&#160;0.15&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.10, kP &#160;=&#160;0.011&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.007) ROIs.

        "ArticleTitle": "HIV-1 Proteins gp120 and Tat Promote Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Invasiveness of HPV-Positive and HPV-Negative Neoplastic Genital and Oral Epithelial Cells. ",
        "AbstractText": "The incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated anogenital and oropharyngeal cancer in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals is substantially higher than in HIV-uninfected individuals. HIV may also be a risk factor for the development of HPV-negative head and neck, liver, lung, and kidney cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying HIV-1-associated increase of epithelial malignancies are not fully understood. Here, we showed that HPV-16-immortalized anal AKC-2 and cervical CaSki epithelial cells that undergo prolonged exposure to cell-free HIV-1 virions or HIV-1 viral proteins gp120 and tat respond with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increased invasiveness. Similar responses were observed in HPV-16-infected SCC-47 and HPV-16-negative HSC-3 oral epithelial cancer cells that were cultured with these viral proteins. EMT induced by gp120 and tat led to detachment of poorly adherent cells from the culture substratum; these cells remained capable of reattachment, upon which they coexpressed both E-cadherin and vimentin, indicative of an intermediate stage of EMT. The reattached cells also expressed stem cell markers CD133 and CD44, which may play a critical role in cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Inhibition of transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#946;1 and MAPK signaling and vimentin expression, and restoration of E-cadherin expression reduced HIV-induced EMT and the invasive activity of HPV-16-immortalized anal and cervical epithelial cells. Collectively, our results suggest that these approaches along with HIV viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy (ART) might be useful to limit the role of HIV-1 infection in the acceleration of HPV-associated or HPV-independent epithelial neoplasia. IMPORTANCE HPV-16-immortalized genital and oral epithelial cells and HPV-negative oral cancer cells that undergo prolonged contact with cell-free HIV-1 virions or with viral proteins gp120 and tat respond by becoming more invasive. EMT cells induced by HIV-1 in cultures of HPV-16-immortalized anal and cervical epithelial cells express the stem cell markers CD133 and CD44. These results suggest that the interaction of HIV-1 with neoplastic epithelial cells may lead to their de-differentiation into cancer stem cells that are resistant to apoptosis and anti-cancer drugs. Thus, this pathway may play a critical role in the development of invasive cancer. Inhibition of TGF-&#946;1 and MAPK signaling and vimentin expression, and restoration of E-cadherin expression reduced HIV-induced EMT and the invasiveness of HPV-16-immortalized anal and cervical epithelial cells. Taken together, these results suggest that these approaches might be exploited to limit the role of HIV-1 infection in the acceleration of HPV-associated or HPV-independent epithelial neoplasia. ",

        "ArticleTitle": "HCV Infection Increases the Expression of ACE2 Receptor, Leading to Enhanced Entry of Both HCV and SARS-CoV-2 into Hepatocytes and a Coinfection State. ",
        "AbstractText": "Recent studies suggest the enhancement of liver injury in COVID-19 patients infected with Hepatitis C virus (HCV). Hepatocytes express low levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, raising the possibility of HCV-SARS-CoV-2 coinfection in the liver. This work aimed to explore whether HCV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfect hepatocytes and the interplay between these viruses. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 coinfects HCV-infected Huh7.5 (Huh7.5HCV) cells. Both viruses replicated efficiently in the coinfected cells, with HCV replication enhanced in coinfected compared to HCV-mono-infected cells. Strikingly, Huh7.5HCV cells were eight fold more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses than naive Huh7.5 cells, suggesting enhanced SARS-CoV-2 entry into HCV-preinfected hepatocytes. In addition, we observed increased binding of spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein to Huh7.5HCV cells, as well as enhanced cell-to-cell fusion of Huh7.5HCV cells with spike-expressing Huh7.5 cells. We explored the mechanism of enhanced SARS-CoV-2 entry and identified an increased ACE2 mRNA and protein levels in Huh7.5HCV cells, primary hepatocytes, and in data from infected liver biopsies obtained from database. Importantly, higher expression of ACE2 increased HCV infection by enhancing its binding to the host cell, underscoring its role in the HCV life cycle as well. Transcriptome analysis revealed that shared host signaling pathways were induced in HCV-SARS-CoV-2 coinfection. This study revealed complex interactions between HCV and SARS-CoV-2 infections in hepatocytes, which may lead to the increased liver damage recently reported in HCV-positive COVID-19 patients. IMPORTANCE Here, we provide the first experimental evidence for the coexistence of SARS-CoV-2 infection with HCV, and the interplay between them. The study revealed a complex relationship of enhancement between the two viruses, where HCV infection increased the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2, thus facilitating SARS-CoV-2 entry, and potentially, also HCV entry. Thereafter, SARS-CoV-2 infection enhanced HCV replication in hepatocytes. This study may explain the aggravation of liver damage that was recently reported in COVID-19 patients with HCV coinfection and suggests preinfection with HCV as a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Moreover, it highlights the possible importance of HCV treatment for coinfected patients. In a broader view, these findings emphasize the importance of identifying coinfecting pathogens that increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and that may accelerate COVID-19-related co-morbidities.

        "AbstractText": "Macroautophagy/autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process pivotal to cellular homeostasis and support of tumorigenesis. Being a potential therapeutic target for cancer, we have worked to understand the implications of autophagy inhibition both systemically, and tumor-specifically. We utilized inducible expression of Atg5 shRNA to temporally control autophagy levels in a reversible manner to study the effects of tumor-intrinsic and systemic autophagic loss and restoration on established KrasG12D/+;trp53-/- (KP) lung tumor growth. We reported that transient systemic ATG5 loss significantly reduces KP lung tumor growth. Through in vivo isotope tracing and metabolic flux analyses, we noted that systemic ATG5 knockdown significantly reduces the uptake of glucose and lactate in lung tumors, leading to impaired TCA cycle metabolism and biosynthesis. Additionally, we observed an increased tumor T cell infiltration in the absence of systemic ATG5, which is essential for T cell-mediated tumor killing. Moreover, the impaired tumor metabolism and increased T cell infiltration are sustained when autophagy is restored in a short term. Finally, we found that intermittent systemic ATG5 knockdown, a mock therapy situation, significantly prolongs the lifespan of mice bearing KP lung tumors. Our findings lay the proof of concept for inhibition of autophagy as a valid approach to cancer therapy. ",

        "AbstractText": "The species Streptomyces venezuelae is represented by several distinct strains with variable abilities to biosynthesize structurally diverse secondary metabolites. In this work, we examined the effect of ethanol shock on the transcriptome and metabolome of Streptomyces venezuelae NRRL B-65442 using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Ethanol shock caused massive changes in the gene expression profile, differentially affecting genes for secondary metabolite biosynthesis and central metabolic pathways. Most of the data from the transcriptome analysis correlated well with the metabolome changes, including the overproduction of jadomycin congeners and a downshift in the production of desferrioxamines, legonoxamine, foroxymithin, and a small cryptic ribosomally synthesized peptide. Some of the metabolome changes, such as the overproduction of chloramphenicol, could not be explained by overexpression of the cognate biosynthetic genes but correlated with the expression profiles of genes for precursor biosynthesis. Changes in the transcriptome were also observed for several genes known to play a role in stress response in other bacteria and included at least 10 extracytoplasmic function &#963; factors. This study provides important new insights into the stress response in antibiotic-producing bacteria and will help to understand the complex mechanisms behind the environmental factor-induced regulation of secondary metabolite biosynthesis. IMPORTANCE Streptomyces spp. are filamentous Gram-positive bacteria known as versatile producers of secondary metabolites, of which some have been developed into human medicines against infections and cancer. The genomes of these bacteria harbor dozens of gene clusters governing the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (BGCs), of which most are not expressed under laboratory conditions. Detailed knowledge of the complex regulation of BGC expression is still lacking, although certain growth conditions are known to trigger the production of previously undetected secondary metabolites. In this work, we investigated the effect of ethanol shock on the production of secondary metabolites by Streptomyces venezuelae and correlated these findings with the expression of cognate BGCs and primary metabolic pathways involved in the generation of cofactors and precursors. The findings of this study set the stage for the rational manipulation of bacterial genomes aimed at enhanced production of industrially important bioactive natural products. ",

Both spheroids were highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and two representative anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents, remdesivir and 5h (an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2's main protease), inhibited the infectivity and replication of SARS-CoV-2 in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that these human-derived induced spheroids should serve as valuable target cells for the evaluation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. IMPORTANCE The hiPSC-derived spheroids we generated are more expensive to obtain than the human cell lines currently available for anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug evaluation, such as Calu-3 cells; however, the spheroids have better infection susceptibility than the existing human cell lines. Although we are cognizant that there are human lung (and colonic) organoid models for the study of SARS-CoV-2, the production of those organoids is greatly more costly and time consuming than the generation of human iPSC-derived spheroid cells. Thus, the addition of human iPSC-derived spheroids for anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug evaluation studies could provide the opportunity for more comprehensive interpretation of the antiviral activity of compounds against SARS-CoV-2.

Using an algorithm based on quantitative sensory testing variables, we grouped 64 consecutive patients with fibromyalgia (20 with small-fibre pathology, 44 without) and 30 patients with pure small-fibre neuropathy into different sensory phenotypes: sensory loss, thermal hyperalgesia, mechanical hyperalgesia, and healthy phenotypes. We found that the frequency of the different sensory phenotypes differed markedly between patients with fibromyalgia and patients with small-fibre neuropathy. In patients with fibromyalgia, with and without small-fibre pathology, healthy and hyperalgesia phenotypes (both thermal and mechanical) were similarly represented, while sensory loss and mechanical hyperalgesia phenotypes were the most frequent phenotypes in patients with small-fibre neuropathy. Our findings indicate that small-fibre damage is associated with distinct sensory phenotypes in patients with fibromyalgia and in patients with small-fibre neuropathy. The lack of phenotype differences between patients with fibromyalgia with and without small-fibre pathology and the relatively high frequency of the healthy phenotype in these patients highlight a complex relationship between small-fibre pathology and pain in patients with fibromyalgia.

The ATC murine model was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of tamoxifen with overexpression of BrafV600E and deletion of Trp53, and the tumors were generated within about 1 month. High-resolution ultrasound was applied to investigate the tumor initiation and progression, and the dynamic growth curve was obtained by measuring the tumor sizes.

Recently, PHGDH has been found to have some non-canonical functions beyond serine biosynthesis, but its specific mechanisms in tumorigenesis remain unclear. Here, we show that PHGDH localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane and promotes the translation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded proteins in liver cancer cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that mitochondrial PHGDH directly interacts with adenine nucleotide translocase 2 (ANT2) and then recruits mitochondrial elongation factor G2 (mtEFG2) to promote mitochondrial ribosome recycling efficiency, thereby promoting mtDNA-encoded protein expression and subsequent mitochondrial respiration. Moreover, we show that treatment with a mitochondrial translation inhibitor or depletion of mtEFG2 diminishes PHGDH-mediated tumor growth.

        "ArticleTitle": "Four-Parameter FluoroSpot Assay Reveals That the Varicella Zoster Virus Elicits a Robust Memory T Cell IL-10 Response throughout Childhood. ",
        "AbstractText": "During childhood, the composition and function of the T cell compartment undergoes significant changes. In healthy individuals, primary infection with herpesviruses is followed by latency, and occasional subclinical reactivation ensures transmission and contributes to an emerging pool of memory T cells. In immunocompromised individuals, herpesviruses can be life threatening. However, knowledge about the spectrum of virus-specific cytokine responses is limited. Here, we investigated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from children with differential carrier statuses for cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) (n&#8201;=&#8201;32, age 1 to 17&#8201;years). We examined memory T cell subsets as well as IFN-&#947;-, IL-10-, IL-17A-, and IL-22-producing T cells after polyclonal activation or stimulation with viral peptides using flow cytometry and a 4-parameter FluoroSpot assay. Age and herpesvirus carriage influenced the size of the memory T cell subsets. A positive association between age and the number of IFN-&#947;-, IL-17A- and IL-22-producing T cells was found following polyclonal activation. For CMV, age was positively associated with IL-17A spot-forming cells (SFC), while for VZV, age was negatively associated with IL-22 and positively associated with IFN-&#947; SFC. Upon activation with CMV, VZV, and EBV peptides, IFN-&#947; SFCs dominated. Notably, VZV responses were characterized by a higher IL-10 SFC population compared to both CMV and EBV. Our findings suggest that cytokine responses vary across herpesvirus-type-specific memory T cells and may more adequately reflect their composition. An observed deviation between polyclonal and herpesvirus-specific T cell cytokine responses in children needs to be considered when interpreting the associations between herpesvirus carrier status and bulk T cell reactivity. In summary, these findings may have implications for the treatment of immunocompromised patients. IMPORTANCE Infection with herpesviruses accounts for 35 to 40 billion human cases worldwide. Despite this, little is known about how herpesviruses shape the immune system in the asymptomatic carrier. Particularly in children, primary infection is connected to no or mild symptoms ahead of latency for life. Most research on cellular responses against herpesviruses focuses on inflammatory cytokines associated with antiproliferative and antitumor mechanisms and not the spectrum of cytokine responses in healthy humans. This study investigated four divergent cytokine-producing T cell responses to herpesviruses, reflecting different immunological functions. Three common childhood herpesviruses were selected: Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and varicella-zoster virus. Curiously, not all viruses induced the same pattern of cytokines. Varicella-zoster responses were characterized by IL-10, which is considered regulatory. Besides broadening understanding of responses to herpesviruses, our results raise the possibility that reactivation of varicella-zoster may be counterproductive in cancer treatment through the action of IL-10-producing T-cells.

        "AbstractText": "Multiplication of the invertebrate DNA baculoviruses activates the host DNA damage response (DDR), which promotes virus DNA replication. DDR signaling is initiated by the host insect's phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-related kinases (PIKKs), including ataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinase (ATM). Like other PIKKs, ATM phosphorylates an array of host DDR proteins at serine/threonine glutamine (S/TQ) motifs, the result of which leads to cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis. To define the role of host PIKKs in baculovirus replication, we compared replication levels of the baculovirus prototype species Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus in permissive Spodoptera frugiperda (SF21) cells with and without ATM function. Caffeine, which inhibits multiple DDR kinases, and the ATM-specific inhibitors KU-55933 and KU-60019 each prevented phosphorylation of Spodoptera histone H2AX (SfH2AX), a recognized indicator of ATM activity. However, only caffeine reduced autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV)-induced bulk phosphorylation of S/TQ protein motifs. Furthermore, only caffeine, not KU-55933 or KU-60019, reduced AcMNPV yields, suggesting a limited role for ATM. To investigate further, we identified and edited the Spodoptera ATM gene (sfatm). Consistent with ATM's known functions, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of sfatm eliminated DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of DDR marker SfH2AX in SF21 cells. However, loss of sfatm failed to affect the levels of AcMNPV multiplication. These findings suggested that in the absence of the kinase SfATM, another caffeine-sensitive host DDR kinase promotes S/TQ phosphorylation and baculovirus multiplication. Thus, baculoviruses activate and utilize the host insect DDR in an ATM-independent manner. IMPORTANCE The DDR, while necessary for the maintenance and fidelity of the host genome, represents an important cellular response to viral infection. The prolific DNA baculoviruses activate and manipulate the invertebrate DDR by using mechanisms that positively impact virus multiplication, including virus DNA replication. As the key DDR initiator kinase, ATM was suspected to play a critical role in this host response. However, we show here that baculovirus AcMNPV activates an ATM-independent DDR. By identifying the insect host ATM ortholog (Spodoptera frugiperda SfATM) and evaluating genetic knockouts, we show that SfATM is dispensable for AcMNPV activation of the DDR and for virus replication. Thus, another PIKK, possibly the closely related kinase ATR (ATM- and Rad3-related kinase), is responsible for efficient baculovirus multiplication. These findings better define the host pathways used by invertebrates to engage viral pathogens, including DNA viruses. ",

E-mental health interventions provide mental health support in a format that may be more accessible for informal caregivers. However, e-mental health interventions are seldom implemented into real-world practice. The overall aim of this mixed-methods systematic review was to examine factors associated with the effectiveness and implementation of e-mental health interventions for informal caregivers of adults with chronic diseases. To achieve this aim, two approaches were adopted: (1) combinations of implementation and/or intervention characteristics sufficient for intervention effectiveness were explored using a qualitative comparative analysis; and (2) barriers and facilitators to the implementation of e-mental health interventions for informal caregivers were explored using a thematic synthesis. Relevant studies published from January 1, 2007 to July 6, 2022 were identified by systematically searching six electronic databases, clinical trial registries, and various secondary search strategies. Studies were included if they reported on the effectiveness or implementation of e-mental health interventions for informal caregivers of adults with cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, diabetes, heart disease, or stroke. Randomized controlled trials reporting on caregivers' mental health outcomes were included in a crisp-set qualitative comparative analysis. Randomized controlled trials were assessed for bias using the Risk of Bias 2.0 tool, and for how pragmatic or explanatory their trial design was using the PRagmatic Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary 2 (PRECIS-2) tool. Studies of any design reporting on implementation were included in a thematic synthesis using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to identify barriers and facilitators to implementation. 53 reports, representing 29 interventions, were included in the review. The majority of interventions (93%) focused on informal cancer or dementia caregivers. 14 reports were included in the qualitative comparative analysis with conditions including the presence of peer or professional support, and key persuasive design features explored. Low consistency and coverage prevented the determination of condition sets sufficient for intervention effectiveness. 44 reports were included in the thematic synthesis. 152 barriers and facilitators were identified, with the majority related to the intervention and individual (informal caregiver) characteristic domains of the CFIR. Implementation barriers and facilitators at the inner (e.g. organizational culture) and outer setting (e.g. external policies and resources) domains are largely unexplored. E-mental health interventions for informal caregivers tend to be well-designed and easy to use, with a number of barriers and facilitators to implementation identified related to the intervention and individual user characteristics.

This study aims to evaluate the effect of digital health interventions using mobile apps to promote PA and QoL in patients with postoperative breast cancer. This study will also identify effective digital intervention methods and perform an economic analysis. The main hypothesis is that the use of mobile healthcare apps will improve health-related quality of life (HRQOL), promote PA, and reduce healthcare costs. The Promotion of a better lifestyle (PA) with Precise and Practicable digital healthcare in postoperative CANCER patients through a Multi-Disciplinary Network (P4CancerMDnet) study is examined by a prospective 4-group randomized controlled trial with a concurrent cost-utility evaluation. Patients are randomly assigned to 3 different mobile app intervention groups or control groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The intervention group is encouraged to use the assigned mobile app. The targeted outcomes are HRQOL, metabolic health markers, and quality-adjusted life-years. The outcomes will be measured at the 6- and 12-month follow-ups. This study will contribute towards a better lifestyle and HRQOL through digital healthcare for postoperative breast cancer patients. These findings are expected to provide evidence of the effectiveness of mobile apps for breast cancer survivors. Clinical Research Information Service Identifier: KCT0005447. ",

        "AbstractText": "Phosphorylated AKT1 (p-AKT1) at Ser473 is a functional isoform of AKT and a key component of the PI3K/mTOR/AKT pathway. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of p-AKT1 (Ser473) based on the molecular subtypes of breast cancer. To investigate the prognostic value of p-AKT1 (Ser473), we performed a retrospective chart review of patients with breast cancer. Data on p-AKT1 (Ser473) positivity, hormone receptor (HR) status, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression status, and other clinicopathological factors were obtained. Furthermore, the therapeutic effect of blocking p-AKT1 (Ser473) in breast cancer cells was evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, cell apoptosis assay, apoptosis protein array, and western blot analysis. A total of 3,044 patients were evaluated, and the median follow-up time was 43 (range: 0-125) months. In patients with HR-positive and HER2-positive disease, the p-AKT1 (Ser473)-positive group had worse disease-free survival (DFS) than the p-AKT1 (Ser473)-negative group (hazard ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.5; p = 0.024). In the multivariate analysis, p-AKT1 (Ser473) remained a significantly worse prognostic factor in patients with HR-positive/HER2-positive breast cancer (p = 0.03). There was no difference in DFS according to p-AKT1 (Ser473) status among patients with other breast cancer subgroups. In vitro analysis showed that blocking p-AKT1 (Ser473) levels enhanced trastuzumab-induced cell death in HR-positive/HER2-positive and p-AKT1 (Ser473)-positive breast cancer cells. p-AKT1 (Ser473) is a prognostic marker for poor outcomes in patients with HR-positive/HER2-positive breast cancer and may have a potential value as a therapeutic target.

        "AbstractText": "We report a scalable fabrication method to generate exosome-mimicking nanovesicles (ENVs) by using a biocompatible, cell-binding lipid detergent during cell extrusion. A PEGylated mannosylerythritol lipid (MELPEG) detergent was rationally engineered to strongly associate with phospholipid membranes to increase cell membrane deformability and the corresponding friction force during extrusion and to enhance the dispersibility of ENVs. Compared to cell extrusion without detergent, cell extrusion in the presence of MELPEG increased the ENV production yield by approximately 20 times and cellular protein content per MELPEG-functionalized ENV by approximately 2-fold relative to that of unmodified ENVs. We verified that MELPEG strongly binds to ENV membranes and increases membrane deformability via expansion/swelling while preserving the integrity of the phospholipid bilayer structure. The results highlight that the MELPEG-aided cell extrusion process broadly applies to various cell lines; hence, it could be helpful in the production of ENVs for tissue regeneration, drug delivery, and cancer nanomedicine.

It is responsible for approximately 3% of adult malignancies, and 90-95% of neoplasms originate from the kidney. Advances in tumor diagnosis, innovative immune therapeutics, and checkpoint inhibitors-based treatment options improved the survival rate of patients with RCC accompanied by different risk factors. RCC Patients with diabetes, hepatitis C virus (HCV), or obesity (OB) may have a comorbidity, and finding the risk factor for better clinical treatment is an urgent issue. Therefore, the study focused on network-based gene expression analysis approaches to learning the impact of RCC on other comorbidities associated with the disease. The study found critical genetic factors and signal transduction pathways that share pathophysiology and commonly use dysregulated genes of the illness. Initially, the study identified 385 upregulated genes and 338 down-regulated genes involved with RCC. OB, chronic kidney disease (CKD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and HCV significantly shared 28, 14, 5, and 3 genes, respectively. RCC shared one downregulated gene versican (VCAN) with OB and HCV and one downregulated gene oxidase homolog 2 (LOXL2) with OB and CKD. Interestingly, most of the shared pathways were linked with metabolism. The study also identified six prospective biomarkers, signaling pathways, and numerous critical regulatory and associated drug candidates for the disease. We believe that the discovery will help explain these diseases' complicated interplay and aid in developing novel therapeutic targets and drug candidates. ",

We performed a retrospective review to identify and describe patients with metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma of the breast at our centre between 2011 and 2021. Medical records, pathology and imaging results were examined to evaluate the clinical and histopathological features as well as the treatment pathways and prognosis of these patients. We present a series of seven female patients with metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma of the breast, as defined by the World Health Organization classification, over a period of 10&#8201;years (2011-2021) from a single centre. Median age at diagnosis was 48&#8201;years (range 39-63). Six of seven tissue samples expressed synaptophysin and chromogranin and were also oestrogen and progesterone receptor positive; median Ki-67 index was 50% (range 20-90%). All seven patients had demonstrated avidity on 18 F-FDG PET imaging, and the six who underwent 68 Ga-DOTATATE PET all had significant avidity. Treatment modalities and sequencing varied, but all patients received chemotherapy during their disease course. Six patients received three or more lines of treatment. Median overall survival was 31.8 months (range 3.7-108.6). Median progression-free survival (PFS) with first-line therapy for metastatic disease was 5.8 months (range 1.8-37.8). This series shows the use of multiple modalities in treating this disease, with different sequencing in different patients. Despite multiple modalities used in the first-line setting, first-line PFS remains short. Larger series and further molecular characterisation are required to aid clinicians in managing this condition and to guide optimal treatment sequencing to improve outcomes in this rare patient group.

However, the rules that determine which tumor-derived peptides will be immunogenic are still incompletely understood. Here, we investigated whether constraints on peptide accessibility to the MHC due to protein subcellular location are associated with peptide immunogenicity potential. Analyzing over 380,000 peptides from studies of MHC presentation and peptide immunogenicity, we find clear spatial biases in both eluted and immunogenic peptides. We find that including parent protein location improves the prediction of peptide immunogenicity in multiple datasets. In human immunotherapy cohorts, the location was associated with a neoantigen vaccination response, and immune checkpoint blockade responders generally had a higher burden of neopeptides from accessible locations.

So far, RET-altered medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) patients treated with selpercatinib showed a remarkable objective response rate and safety profile. However, new treatment emerging adverse events (TEAEs) have been recently reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence, features, and clinical management of effusions that are one of these TEAEs. Ten of 11 patients with advanced MTC enrolled in the LIBRETTO-201 clinical trial at Endocrinology Unit of the Pisa University Hospital were evaluated for the presence and management of effusions. We retrospectively evaluated MTC patients treated with selpercatinib. The presence of pleural, pericardial, abdominal and/or pelvic effusions was evaluated by reviewing the computerized tomography scan performed during the study protocol and up to 24 months of observation. All but one MTC patient experienced previous MKIs treatment. Three patients already had effusions before starting selpercatinib treatment. New effusions appeared in 8/10 (80%) patients during the treatment. In patients submitted to fluid aspiration a chylous nature was documented. Whenever a dose reduction was performed a significant positive effect was observed. Chylous effusions are a new TEAE of selpercatinib treatment. They can appear or worsening at any time during the treatment. Cases with asymptomatic and mild effusions, active surveillance may be appropriate and safe. In symptomatic and/or moderate/severe cases, aspiration of the fluid and a dose reduction can improve this AE, strongly supporting a cause-effect correlation with selpercatinib. ",

Data on the epidemiology and management of pediatric brain tumors in Uganda are limited. We aimed to assess the clinicopathological profile and management of pediatric brain tumors at the national oncology center in Uganda since the inception of weekly multidisciplinary meetings. Records of children younger than19 years diagnosed with primary brain tumors at Uganda Cancer Institute between 2017 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Patient and tumor characteristics were collected with multidisciplinary team management treatment plans for analysis. There were 35 patients evaluated, most of whom were males (57.1%). Craniopharyngioma (n&#8201;=&#8201;9, 25.7%) was the most common brain tumor, followed by astrocytoma (n&#8201;=&#8201;5, 14.2%) and medulloblastoma (n&#8201;=&#8201;4, 11.4%). Management included surgical resection in 28.5% of patients, chemotherapy (28.6%), radiotherapy (17.1%) and palliative care (20.0%).

How EC elongation is dynamically regulated in vivo is not fully understood. Here, we generated a zebrafish mutant, deficient for the integrin adaptor protein Talin1. Using a new Focal Adhesion (FA) marker line, expressing endothelial Vinculinb-eGFP, we demonstrated that EC FAs function dynamically and are lost in our talin1 mutants, allowing us to uncouple the primary roles of FAs in ECs morphogenesis, from the secondary effects that occur due to systemic vessel failure or loss of blood flow. Talin1 loss led to compromised F-actin rearrangements, perturbed EC elongation and disrupted cell-cell junction linearisation in vessel remodelling. Finally, chemical induction of actin polymerisation restored FA dynamics and EC elongation during vascular morphogenesis. Together, we have identified that FAs are essential for EC elongation and junction linearisation in flow pressured vessels and influence actin polymerisation in cellular morphogenesis. These observations can explain the severely compromised vessel beds and vascular leakage observed in mutant models that lack integrin signalling. ",

Inorganic MCM-41 silica nanoparticles were synthesized, functionalized with phenylboronic acid groups (MCM-B), and capped with dextran (MCM-B-D). The nanoparticles were then characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, zeta potential analysis, nitrogen sorption, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis, before exploring their potential for drug loading and controlled drug release. This was done using a model prostate cancer drug, DOX, and a targeted prostate cancer drug, &#945;-Methyl Acyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) antibody-conjugated DOX, which attaches specifically to AMACR proteins that are overexpressed on the surfaces of prostate cancer cells. The kinetics of sustained drug release over 30&#8201;days was then studied using zeroth order, first order, second order, Higuchi, and the Korsmeyer-Peppas models, while the thermodynamics of drug release was elucidated by determining the entropy and enthalpy changes. The flux of the released DOX was also simulated using the COMSOL Multiphysics software package. Generally, the AMACR antibody-conjugated DOX drug-loaded nanoparticles were more effective than the free DOX drug-loaded formulations in inhibiting the growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro over a 96&#8201;h period.

        "AbstractText": "Metastatic pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) have poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. The recent advent of immunotherapies showing remarkable clinical efficacies against various cancer types offers the possibility of novel opportunities also for metastatic PPGL. Most PPGL are pathogenically linked to inactivating mutations in genes encoding different succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) subunits. This causes activation of the hypoxia inducible factor 2 (HIF2)-mediated transcriptional program in the absence of decreased intratumoral oxygen levels, a phenomenon known as pseudohypoxia. Genuine hypoxia in a tumor creates an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. However, the impact of pseudohypoxia in the immune landscape of tumors remains largely unexplored. In this study, tumoral expression of PD-L1 and HIF2&#945;, and tumor infiltration of CD8 T lymphocytes (CTL) was examined in PPGL specimens from 102 patients. We assessed associations between PD-L1, CTL infiltration, HIF2&#945; expression and the mutational status of SDH genes. Our results show that high PD-L1-expression levels in tumor cells and CTL tumor infiltration was more frequent in metastatic than non-metastatic PPGL. However, this phenotype was negatively associated with SDH-mutations and high HIF2&#945; protein expression. These data were validated by analysis of mRNA levels of genes expressing PD-L1, CD8 and HIF2&#945; in PPGL included in the TCGA database. Further, PD-L1 and CD8 expression was lower in norepinephrine than epinephrine-secreting PPGL. This in silico analysis also revealed the low PD-L1 or CD8 expression levels in tumors with inactivating mutations in VHL or activating mutations in the HIF2&#945;-coding gene, EPAS1, which, together with SDH-mutated tumors, comprise the pseudohypoxic molecular subtype of PPGL. These findings suggest that pseudohypoxic tumor cells induce extrinsic signaling towards the immune cells promoting the development of an immunosuppressive environment. It also provides compelling support to explore the differential response of metastatic PPGL to immune checkpoint inhibitors. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. ",

Prognostic factors, such as growth, invasion and metastasis of malignant tumors, are closely related to changes in physiological parameters, including hypoxia, enzymes, low extracellular pH, and reduction conditions. Therefore, it is of great clinical significance to study tumor microenvironment markers to evaluate tumor progression and predict therapeutic effects. Organic fluorescent dyes are popular because of their small size, easy modification, adjustable luminescence and simple elucidation of their mechanism, and are widely used in tumor diagnosis and treatment.

        "AbstractText": "Oral cancer is a paradigm of Slaughter's concept of field cancerization, where tumors are thought to originate within an area of cells containing genetic alterations that predispose to cancer development. The field size is unclear but may represent a large area of tissue, and the origin of mutations is also unclear. Here, we analyzed whole exome and transcriptome features in contralateral tumor-distal tongue (i.e. distant from the tumor, not tumor-adjacent) and corresponding tumor tissues from 15 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue. The number of point mutations ranged from 41 to 237 in tumors and from 1 to 78 in tumor-distal samples. Tumor-distal samples showed mainly clock-like (associated with aging) or tobacco smoking mutational signatures. Tumors additionally showed mutations that associate with cytidine deaminase AID/APOBEC enzyme activities, or a UV-like signature. Importantly, no point mutations were shared between a tumor and the matched tumor-distal sample in any patient. TP53 was the most frequently mutated gene in tumors (67%), whereas TP53 mutation was detected in only one tumor-distal sample and this mutation was not shared with the matched tumor. Arm-level copy number variation (CNV) was found in 12 tumors, with loss of chromosome (Chr) 8p and/or gain of 8q being the most frequent events. Two tumor-distal samples showed gain of Chr8, which was associated with increased expression of Chr8-located genes in these samples although gene ontology did not show a role for these genes in oncogenic processes. In situ hybridization revealed a mixed pattern of Chr8 gain and neutral copy number in both tumor cells and adjacent non-tumor epithelium in one patient. We conclude that distant field cancerization exists but does not present as tumor-related mutational events. The data are compatible with etiologic field effects, rather than the classical monoclonal field cancerization theory. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. ",

        "ArticleTitle": "Phosphatidic Acid Mediates the Nem1-Spo7/Pah1 Phosphatase Cascade in Yeast Lipid Synthesis. ",
        "AbstractText": "In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the PAH1-encoded Mg2+-dependent phosphatidate (PA) phosphatase Pah1 regulates the bifurcation of PA to diacylglycerol (DAG) for triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis and to CDP-DAG for phospholipid synthesis. Pah1 function is mainly regulated via control of its cellular location by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Pah1 phosphorylated by multiple protein kinases is sequestered in the cytosol apart from its substrate PA in the membrane. The phosphorylated Pah1 is then recruited and dephosphorylated by the protein phosphatase complex Nem1 (catalytic subunit)-Spo7 (regulatory subunit) in the endoplasmic reticulum. The dephosphorylated Pah1 hops onto and scoots along the membrane to recognize PA for its dephosphorylation to DAG. Here, we developed a proteoliposome model system that mimics the Nem1-Spo7/Pah1 phosphatase cascade to provide a tool for studying Pah1 regulation. Purified Nem1-Spo7 was reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles prepared in accordance with the phospholipid composition of the nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The Nem1-Spo7 phosphatase reconstituted in the proteoliposomes, which were measured 60&#160;nm in an average diameter, was catalytically active on Pah1 phosphorylated by Pho85-Pho80, and its active site was located at the external side of the phospholipid bilayer. Moreover, we determined that PA stimulated the Nem1-Spo7 activity, and the regulatory effect was governed by the nature of the phosphate headgroup but not by the fatty acyl moiety of PA. The reconstitution system for the Nem1-Spo7/Pah1 phosphatase cascade, which starts with the phosphorylation of Pah1 by Pho85-Pho80 and ends with the production of DAG, is a significant advance to understand a regulatory cascade in yeast lipid synthesis.

        "AbstractText": "A novel drug loading system, Au@Si-N&#57345;N-Si@SiO2, is constructed by a layer-by-layer assembly approach. The core Au nanorods serve as the matrix for a near-infrared light (NIR) responsive photothermal feature. Meanwhile, the assembly's middle shell is composed of azobenzene linked silica, which produces free radicals by breaking -N&#57345;N- bonds at a high temperature brought about by a NIR irradiation-caused photothermal effect, which further triggers the loaded drug release. The outer shell is formed of SiO2 in order to prevent leakage of drug in the middle layer. The fully drug loaded nanocarriers, Au@Si-N&#57345;N-Si@SiO2-Dox, exhibit an excellent photothermal effect (43%) at a concentration of 170 &#956;g mL-1 under 808 nm NIR laser at 2.3 W cm-2. The antitumor performance of Au@Si-N&#57345;N-Si@SiO2-Dox was investigated using human colon cancer cells (HCT116) as a model. By combining NIR-triggered drug release, free radical generation and the photothermal effect, the proposed Au@Si-N&#57345;N-Si@SiO2-Dox exhibits improved antitumor efficiency. By using a dosage of 170 &#956;g mL-1, a cell viability of 17.56% is achieved for HCT116 (5 &#215; 103-1 &#215; 104 cells per well) with 10 min of NIR laser irradiation (808 nm, 2.3 W cm-2). All the results demonstrate that Au@Si-N&#57345;N-Si@SiO2-Dox exhibits wonderful dosage-dependent antitumor performance and has great potential as a therapeutic agent for tumors or even for use in the clinic.

        "AbstractText": "Aims. Histopathologic benign mimickers of prostate cancer have mostly focused on glandular mimics, with non-glandular mimics mainly limited to inflammatory conditions. While there is a paucity of literature recognizing small cystic (presumably artifactual) spaces in transurethral resection specimens, in some instances they can become florid enough to mimic vascular or epithelial neoplasms. Herein, we detailed histologic, immunophenotypic, and clinicopathologic findings in a large series of specimens showing prominent diagnostically confounding cystic spaces. Methods and Results. Sixty specimens were obtained (50 transurethral resections, 7 aquablations, 3 laser enucleations), from 17 different surgeons. Seven specimens had concurrent genitourinary pathology (4 prostatic adenocarcinoma, 1 solitary fibrous tumor, 1 prostatic atypia, 1 urothelial carcinoma in situ). The extent of cystic change among overall tissue examined ranged from 1&#8197;mm-8&#8197;mm (mean 3.4&#8197;mm), with luminal content of cystic spaces characterized as empty (72%), both empty and fluid-like (17%), and both empty and mucin-like (11%; mucin histochemical stain was negative on all specimens). Notable differences in degree of tissue cautery artifact or inflammation was not found. Immunohistochemistry performed on 30 specimens showed cystic spaces negative for S100, ERG, pankeratin, and CD45. Conclusion. Although artifactual in nature, in some instances small cystic spaces encountered in prostatic transurethral resections and more novel related procedures can become florid enough to warrant recognition as a potential diagnostic confounder of vascular or epithelial neoplasms.

        "AbstractText": "Introduction. Pancreatoblastoma is a rare malignant epithelial neoplasm of the pancreas, which often shows multiple lines of differentiation, but is defined by neoplastic cells with acinar differentiation and characteristic squamoid nests. Pediatric patients are most commonly affected, and although a subset is known to occur in adults, the diagnosis is rarely considered in elderly adults. Methods. The clinicopathologic features of two cases of pancreatoblastoma in elderly patients were examined. Results. Two patients (age 80 and 81 years) presented with pancreatoblastoma, including one with early-stage pancreatic disease and one with liver metastasis. Biopsies and one pancreatic resection specimen showed characteristic histomorphologic features, including prominent acinar differentiation and abundant squamoid nests. Both cases had complete loss of SMAD4 (DPC4) immunolabeling. Next generation sequencing was performed on one case and revealed copy number loss of chromosome 11p and 9p21 (CDKN2A/B) and pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in APC, SMAD4, and PIK3CA. The APC and SMAD4 variants occurred at allele frequencies suggestive of germline mutations, raising the possibility that this patient may have an inherited cancer predisposition syndrome. Conclusions. We present two cases which extend the upper age limit for reported pancreatoblastoma, including one with genetic findings suggestive of an inherited cancer predisposition syndrome. ",

        "AbstractText": "Silicone breast implants are frequently used for breast augmentation for cosmetic purposes, as well as for breast reconstruction after prophylactic or therapeutic mastectomy. Silicone lymphadenopathy is a well-known complication of silicone breast implants. Silicone droplets are present in the breast tissue through 'silicone bleeding' of the implant or because of implant rupture. These silicone particles can migrate from the breast to the regional lymph nodes. Silicone lymphadenopathy is caused by a substantial foreign body reaction against these silicone particles, and is frequently associated with asteroid body-containing multinucleated giant cells. Similar multinucleated giant cells are often observed in the capsule surrounding the silicone breast implant, and the number of associated asteroid bodies is highly variable. Here, we discuss a series of twelve women with breast implant-related asteroid bodies in their lymph nodes and/or breast tissue. This pictorial essay illustrates that the presence of asteroid bodies in a lymph node does not necessarily suggests a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Clinical information about the patient having (or having had) silicone breast implants is often lacking. The encounter of asteroid body-containing giant cells in lymph node cytology, biopsies or resections should therefore lead to reflex clinical-pathological correlation, before establishing a final diagnosis.

By enhancing laboratory demonstrations with digital technology, these structural issues can be addressed while at the same time enhancing student understanding and learning. Our case study focuses on the fermentation lab part of the Reaction Equilibria and Thermodynamics (RET) module, a first-year chemical engineering course at the University of Birmingham. Video demonstrations were used to introduce students to the laboratory set-ups and walk them through each step and technique. The video demonstrations allowed the students to attend the in-person lab sessions having established knowledge and understanding of the processes involved and the outcomes desired, which decreased the burden on the facilities and the staff. A knowledge-based quiz and a student survey conducted at the end of the module showed that the pre-lab videos encouraged more active participation in the laboratory sessions and reinforced learning. Approximately 70% of the students polled in the first survey conducted within this project felt more confident going into the laboratory sessions after watching the pre-lab videos and attempting the knowledge quiz, while 92% of the students polled in the second survey judged the pre-lab video sessions as beneficial to them. Overall, the teaching method has the potential to improve student participation and access, boost confidence and learning, and provided a more structured and flexible approach to laboratory learning outcomes.

        "AbstractText": "Certain anaerobic microbes with the capability to colonize in tumor microenvironment tend to express the heterologous gene in a sustainable manner, which would inevitably comprise the therapeutic efficacy and induce off-tumor toxicity in vivo. To improve the therapeutic precision and controllability of bacteria-based therapeutics, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) engineered to sense blue light and release the encoded flagellin B (flaB), is conjugated with lanthanide upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) for near-infrared (NIR) nano-optogenetic cancer immunotherapy. Upon 808&#160;nm photoirradiation, UCNPs emit at the blue region to photoactivate the EcN for secretion of flaB, which subsequently binds to Toll-like receptor 5 expressed on the membrane of macrophages for activating immune response via MyD88-dependent signal pathway. Such synergism leads to significant tumor regression in different tumor models and metastatic tumors with negligible side effects. Our studies based on NIR nano-optogenetic platform highlight the rational of leveraging the optogenetic tools combined natural propensity of certain bacteria for cancer immunotherapy.

        "AbstractText": "Nanoprobes (NPs) in the second near-infrared biowindow (NIR-II, 1000-1700&#160;nm) have been developed and widely used in cancer phototheranostics. However, most NIR-II NPs exhibit low phototheranostic efficiency due to their tedious synthetic routes, large particle sizes (> 20&#160;nm), and lack of active targeting properties. Here, we report a miniature NIR-II NPs, named HSA-ICG-iRGD, for active-targeted NIR-II phototheranostics of brain tumors. The HSA-ICG-iRGD probes are designed based on hydrophobic interactions as well as hydrogen bonds between albumin and indocyanine green derivatives (ICG-iRGD) via molecular docking. The as-prepared NPs have a compact size of 10&#160;nm and show tumor-targeting ability by specifically binding to &#945;v &#946;3 integrin receptors which are highly expressed on the surface of brain tumor cells via iRGD peptides. The HSA-ICG-iRGD NPs are then applied to perform active-targeted NIR-II fluorescence imaging, resulting in a signal-to-background ratio (SBR) of 6.85 in orthotopic glioma mouse models. Under the selected laser irradiation of 808&#160;nm, the photothermal effect of HSA-ICG-iRGD extend the survival of the tumor-bearing mice to 55 days, significantly longer than that of the control group (30 days).

We used a prospective survey consisting of a 11-multiple-choice questionnaire evaluating statistical associations with Chi-Square-test or Fisher-exact-test. Multinomial-logistic-regression was performed on items with more than two response categories. Odds ratio (OR) with 95%&#8201;CI were computed to estimate the probability of a specific response according to patient's characteristics. In the 800 analysed questionnaires, 51% of respondents confirmed to have knowledge of AI. Of these, 88% expressed a positive opinion about its use in medicine. Non-Italian respondents were associated with the belief of having a deep awareness about AI more often than Italian respondents (OR = 1.91;95%&#8201;CI[1.10-3.33]). Higher education level was associated with better opinions on the use of AI in medicine (OR = 4.69;95%&#8201;CI[1.36-16.12]). According to 94% of respondents, the radiologists should always produce their own report on mammograms, whilst 77% agreed that AI should be used as a second reader. Most respondents (52%) considered that both the software developer and the radiologist should be held accountable for AI errors. Most of the females undergoing screening in our Institute approve the introduction of AI, although only as a support to radiologist, and not in substitution thereof.

        "AbstractText": "Owing to its robustness properties, marginal interpretations, and ease of implementation, the pseudo-partial likelihood method proposed in the seminal papers of Pepe and Cai (1993) and Lin et&#160;al. (2000) has become the default approach for analyzing recurrent event data with Cox-type proportional rate models. However, the construction of the pseudo-partial score function ignores the dependency among recurrent events and thus can be inefficient. An attempt to investigate the asymptotic efficiency of weighted pseudo-partial likelihood estimation found that the optimal weight function involves the unknown variance-covariance process of the recurrent event process and may not have closed-form expression. Thus, instead of deriving the optimal weights, we propose to combine a system of pre-specified weighted pseudo-partial score equations&#160;via the generalized method of moments and empirical likelihood estimation. We show that a substantial efficiency gain can be easily achieved without imposing additional model assumptions. More importantly, the proposed estimation procedures can be implemented with existing software. Theoretical and numerical analyses show that the empirical likelihood estimator is more appealing than the generalized method of moments estimator when the sample size is sufficiently large.

The proposed estimation procedure incorporates an additional likelihood component to account for uncertainty in the external information and employs a density ratio model to characterize population heterogeneity. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator and show that it is more efficient than the conventional pseudo-partial likelihood estimator without combining information.

RT-qPCR and clinical analysis revealed that CARMN and BTG2 were downregulated while miR-92a-3p was upregulated in CC tissues and cells and their expressions were correlated with clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis. MTT assay, flow cytometry, and Transwell assays revealed that CARMN overexpression reduced proliferation, migration, and invasion and increased apoptosis rate in CC cells.

The median first-line PFS and OS in the low PIV group were 10 months (95% CI: 7.77-12.22) and 18 months (95% CI: 10.66-25.33), respectively. The PFS and OS in the high PIV group were 3 months (95% CI: 1.49-4.51) and 4 months (95% CI: 1.47-6.52), respectively (for PFS p=0.001, for OS p<0.001). In the low-risk (0-1) PILE score group, the median first line PFS and OS were 8 months (95% CI: 6.49-9.50) and 17 months (95% CI: 8.19-25.80), respectively. The high-risk (2-3) group, PFS and OS were 3 months (95% CI: 0-5.99), and 3 months (95% CI: 1.02-4.97), respectively (for PFS p=0.02, for OS p<0.001). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, PIV (HR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.11-2.93, p=0.016) and ECOG PS (HR: 0.72, 95% CI: 1.34-3.19, p=0.01) were independent risk factors for OS. The findings suggest that PIV and PILE score could be used as a prognostic biomarker at the time of diagnosis in patients with HCC. With prospective studies confirming these data, PIV and PILE can be used as a potential standard marker in HCC. ",

        "AbstractText": "Activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer is associated with acquired resistance to trastuzumab. This randomized controlled trial (RCTs) meta-analysis was designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors in combination with trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer. We searched on Web of Knowledge, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, CNKI, and ClinicalTrials.Gov for RCTs comparing PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors plus trastuzumab vs. standard trastuzumab treatments. Pooled estimates of progression-free survival (PFS), pathologic complete response (pCR), and incidence of adverse events were determined. 5 studies out of 610 were found to be eligible and were included in our analysis (n=1,548 participants). PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors combination with trastuzumab treatments resulted in a statistically significant increase in PFS compared with conventional trastuzumab therapy (HR 0.82; 95% CI: 0.76-0.90; p<0.00001). The new combination treatment was more effective on hormone receptor-negative patients (HR 0.73; 95% CI: 0.58-0.93; p=0.010). In addition, the combination of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors with trastuzumab slightly increased the risk of some adverse events, such as neutropenia, leukopenia, fatigue, and anemia. The combination treatments of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors and trastuzumab for PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors combined with trastuzumab treatments for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer can improve median progression-free survival while increasing the incidence of adverse events. It is still controversial based on the current evidence. Due to the limited number and quality of included studies, more high-quality studies are needed for further analysis. ",

        "AbstractText": "Cisplatin is a standard chemotherapeutic agent for advanced bladder cancer, but its efficacy is limited due to drug resistance. Vitamin D3 may reverse cancer multidrug resistance, but the potential molecular mechanisms are still only partially known. The purpose of this study was to explore the mechanism by which vitamin D3 reverses cisplatin resistance in bladder cancer to improve therapeutic efficacy and ameliorate the prognosis of cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer. The levels of vitamin D3 and sirtuin 1 protein were detected in cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer patients and cisplatin-sensitive patients. The cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer cell lines T24/DDP and UMUC3R were used as cell experimental models, and the migration, apoptosis, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species accumulation and autophagy of cells were assessed in the present study. Vitamin D3 levels were decreased, and sirtuin 1 protein levels were increased in cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer patients compared with cisplatin-sensitive bladder cancer patients. Vitamin D3 treatment markedly repressed sirtuin 1 expression, and overexpression of the sirtuin 1 gene led to mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation, promoted the initiation of autophagosome formation and enhanced autophagic flux. Cisplatin treatment in the presence of vitamin D3 inhibited cell invasion and migration and induced apoptosis and enhancing the sirtuin 1 gene abolished the effect of vitamin D3 by regulating mitochondrial reactive oxygen species accumulation and autophagosome formation. These data support a mechanism wherein the sirtuin 1 gene plays a crucial role in vitamin D3 reversing cisplatin resistance in bladder cancer and may provide useful preventive and therapeutic applications in the future.

Our study aims to reveal the effect of TB on the long-term outcomes of patients and to reveal whether there is a difference in tumor location and TB in colonic cancer. A cohort of 100 patients with non-metastatic colon cancer was included in the study. The clinicopathological information of the patients was reviewed. Patients' preparations were re-evaluated to identify TB as: low, medium, and high and represent 0-4 buds, 5-9 buds, and 10 or more buds per 0.785 mm2, respectively. Long-term oncological outcomes of patients were analyzed. The recurrence, metastasis, and final status of the patients were determined during the follow-up period. Low TN was associated with <65 year (p = 0.048), absence of lymphatic metastasis (p = 0.003), and absence of perineural invasion (p = 0.023). High TB was associated with higher pT stage (p = 0.017) and tumor stage (p = 0.005). Additionally, right-sided tumors had a high TB score than left side (82.3% vs. 23.6%, p = 0.011). Patients with high TB had lower overall survival, but these were not statically significant. According to multiple regression analysis, mortality risk was associated with age (p = 0.046), pN status (p = 0.003) and TB (p = 0.040). High TB is associated with mortality in colon cancer and is more common in right colonic carcinoma. ",

In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed people of all ages with CNS cancer in China from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 2019. We collected the data including incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2019. The age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), age-standardized death rate (ASDR), and DALYs rate were compared by age and sex. In 2019, there were more than 94 (95% uncertainty intervals [CI]: 73-114) thousand incident cases, 63 (47-76) thousand deaths and 2.0 (1.5-2.5) million DALYs due to CNS cancer in China in 2019.

Pectins - a class of dietary fibers - are polysaccharides that have a complex structure with a wide range of direct and indirect biological beneficial effects on humans. Direct effects include dilution of carcinogens, reduction in cholesterol levels, and interaction with immune cells. Indirect effects include the fermentation and production of short-chain fatty acids. All these biological effects have implications for colon cancer development; however, the exact mechanisms are not fully understood. In this review, we explore the clinical trials regarding dietary fibers and colorectal cancer, thus indicating the potential anti-cancer effects of pectins and modified pectins. We focused on the emerging biological effects of pectins through targeting colorectal cancer hallmark effects and the enabling characteristics. We provide an overview of the mechanisms for each hallmark capability and how the different pectins might exert that anti-cancer effect, such as induction of apoptosis, reduction in cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. The data compilation described herein can guide future clinical trials to investigate how to target specific pectin structures to act as an adjuvant in colon cancer treatment. ",

The infection cycle of SARS-CoV-2 involves several related steps, including virus entry, gene expression, RNA replication, assembly of infectious virions and their egress. For all of these steps, the virus relies on and exploits host cell factors, cellular organelles, and processes such as endocytosis, nuclear transport, protein secretion, metabolite transport at membrane contact sites and exocytotic pathways. To do this, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved multifunctional viral proteins that hijack cellular factors and modulate their function by unique strategies. In this Review, we highlight cellular trafficking factors, processes, and organelles of relevance to the SARS-CoV-2 infection cycle and how viral proteins make use of and perturb cellular transport during the viral infection cycle.

        "AbstractText": "In vitro cell cultures are most often performed in unphysiological hyperoxia since the oxygen partial pressure of conventional incubators is set at 141 mmHg (18.6%, close to ambient air oxygen 20.1%). This value is higher than human tissue oxygen levels, as the in vivo oxygen partial pressures range from 104 mmHg (lung alveoli) to 8 mmHg (skin epidermis). Importantly, under pathological conditions such as cancer, cells can experience oxygen pressure lower than the healthy tissue. Although hypoxic incubators can regulate gas oxygen, they do not take into account the dissolved oxygen concentration in the cell culture medium. In the context of organ on chip and micro-physiological system development, we present here a new system, called Oxalis (OXygen ALImentation System) that allows fine control of the dissolved oxygen level in the cell culture medium. Oxalis regulates simultaneously the gas composition and the inlet reservoir pressure by modulating the pneumatic valve opening. This dual regulation allows both the pressure driven liquid flowrate and the level of oxygen dissolved in the chip to be controlled independently. Oxalis offers unprecedented features such as an oxygen equilibration time lower than 3 minutes and an accuracy of 3 mmHg. These performances can be reached for chip perfusion flow as low as 1 &#956;L min-1. This low flow rate allows the shear stress experienced by the cells in the chip to be accurately controlled. In addition, the system enables modulation of the pH in the cell culture medium through the modulation of CO2. The fine control and monitoring of both O2 and pH pave the way for new precise investigations on physiological and pathological biological processes. Using Oxalis in the context of tumor-on-chip, we demonstrate the capacity of the system to recapitulate hypoxia-induced gene expression, offering an innovative strategy for future studies on the role of hypoxia in malignant progression and drug resistance.

We performed whole-brain regression of hypothalamic rsFC against Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) total score and behavioral, cognitive, and emotional subscores in 29 patients with AD/MCI and 28 healthy controls (HC), controlling for age, sex, education, cognitive status, and depression. We evaluated the results at a corrected threshold and employed path analyses to assess possible interaction between hypothalamic rsFCs, apathy and depression/memory. Finally, we re-examined the findings in a subsample of amyloid-&#946;-verified AD. AES total score correlated negatively with hypothalamic precuneus (PCu)/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and positively with left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and supramarginal gyrus rsFCs.

Emotional subscore correlated negatively with hypothalamic calcarine cortex rsFC. In path analyses, hypothalamic-PCu/PCC rsFC negatively modulated apathy and, in turn, depression. The model where hypothalamic MTG rsFC and memory independently modulated apathy also showed a good fit. The findings of diminished hypothalamic-PCu/PCC rsFC in relation to apathy and depression were confirmed in amyloid-verified AD. The findings together support a role of altered hypothalamic connectivity in relation to apathy and depression, and modulation of apathy by memory dysfunction. ",

They are randomly divided into training set (n&#8202;=&#8202;120) and validation set (n&#8202;=&#8202;60) and are categorized into effective group (n&#8202;=&#8202;83) and ineffective group (n&#8202;=&#8202;97) according to RECIST 1.1. Clinicopathological features are compared between two groups using Chi-Squared test. CT radiomic features of region of interest (ROI) for gastric tumors are extracted, filtered and minimized to select optimal features and develop radiomics model to predict the response to NAC using Pyradiomics software. Furthermore, a nomogram model is constructed with the radiomic and clinicopathological features via logistic regression analysis. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, the calibration curve is used to test the agreement between prediction probability of the nomogram and actual clinical findings, and the decision curve analysis (DCA) is performed to assess the clinical usage of the nomogram model. Four optimal radiomic features are selected to construct the radiomics model with the areas under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.754 and 0.743, sensitivity of 0.732 and 0.750, specificity of 0.729 and 0.708 in the training set and validation set, respectively.

The calibration curve generates a concordance index of 0.912 indicating good agreement of the prediction results between the nomogram model and the actual clinical observation results. DCA shows that patients can receive higher net benefits within the threshold probability range from 0 to 1.0 in the nomogram model than in the radiomics model.

The analyses comprised all patients with prevalent fatigue at T0 (N= 1,023). Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using the Ward method and including the dichotomized factors emotional distress, pain, insomnia, and obesity. Emotional distress, i.e. depressive symptoms and anxiety, was assessed by the PHQ-4. Pain and insomnia were based on the according symptom scores of the EORTC QLQ-C30. Analysis of covariance was conducted to investigate the association of the fatigue clusters at T0 with subsequent fatigue at T1. Four hierarchical clusters were identified. The first cluster comprised patients with moderate-to-severe distress. The remaining fatigue cases were differentiated by obesity and then by pain. Fatigue cases without any of these three symptoms formed the last cluster. Physical, emotional and cognitive fatigue were highest in the distress cluster. Additionally, this cluster was associated with higher physical, emotional and cognitive fatigue at T1 compared to the other clusters. Fatigue in conjunction with emotional distress had worse impact, persisted longer, and may require other treatment approaches than fatigue in patients without emotional distress.

        "AbstractText": "To describe oncological outcomes after progressive site-directed therapy (PSDT) in genuine and induced oligometasatic (OM)-castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Thirty-seven patients with OM-CRPC treated with PSDT were retrospectively analyzed, and oncological outcomes and recurrence patterns on whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI (WB-DWI) were evaluated. Twenty-two (59%) were classified as genuine OM-CRPC and 15 (41%) as induced OM-CRPC. A 50% decline in PSA after PSDT was observed in 21 (95%) genuine OM-CRPCs and 7 (47%) induced OM-CRPCs (p&#160;=&#160;0.0005). At a median observation period of 7.3&#160;months, median PSA progression-free survival were 10.9&#160;months in the genuine OM-CRPCs and 4.8&#160;months in the induced OM-CRPCs (p&#160;=&#160;0.015). Among the patients who developed PSA progression after PSDT, 11 of 15 in the genuine OM-CRPCs (73%) and 11 of 14 in the induced OM-CRPCs (79%) underwent WB-DWI at PSA progression. The median numbers of newly detected metastases were 2 (range: 1-5) in the genuine OM-CRPCs and 4 (range: 1-40) in the induced OM-CRPCs (p&#160;=&#160;0.049). Only one new metastasis appeared in 5 patients from the genuine OM-CRPCs (46%) and 1 from the induced OM-CRPCs (9.1%, p&#160;=&#160;0.048). In 7 of 9 patients from the genuine OM-CRPCs (78%) and 7 of 8 patients from the induced OM-CRPCs (88%) who had bone metastases alone, the newly detected metastasis limited to the bone. Genuine OM-CRPC had better oncological outcomes after PSDT than induced OM-CRPC, and the number of lesions detected at recurrence was limited. Induced OM-CRPC might be a disseminated condition with micrometastases at OM diagnosis. ",

        "AbstractText": "To assess the effect of the Global Budget Revenue (GBR) program on outcomes after surgery. There is limited data summarizing the effect of the GBR program on surgical outcomes as compared to traditional fee-for-service systems. The Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were used to conduct a systematic literature search on April 5th, 2022. We identified full-length reports of comparative studies involving patients who underwent surgery in Maryland following implementation of the GBR program. A random-effects model calculated the overall pooled estimate for each outcome which included complications, rates of readmission and mortality, length of stay (LOS), and costs. Fourteen studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, with 8 unique studies included in the meta-analysis. Our analytical sample was comprised of 170,011 Maryland patients, 78,171 patients in the pre-GBR group and 91,840 patients in the post-GBR group. The pooled analysis identified modest reductions in costs [Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) -0.34; 95% CI: -0.42, -0.25; P<0.001], complications [Odds Ratio (OR) 0.57; 95% CI: 0.36-0.92, P=0.02], readmission (OR 0.78; 95% CI: 0.72-0.85, P<0.001), mortality (OR 0.58; 95% CI: 0.47-0.72, P<0.001), and LOS (SMD -0.26; 95% CI: -0.32, -0.2, P<0.001) after surgery. Implementation of the GBR program is associated with improved outcomes and reductions in costs among Maryland patients who underwent surgical procedures. This is particularly salient given the increasing need to disseminate and scale population-based payment models that improve patient care while controlling health care costs. ",

For patients with advanced progressive PC, the treatment strategies include second-line endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. Such therapeutic techniques are either too expensive or too toxic for some patients, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has become an alternative for its low cost and low toxicity. The application of Shi-pi-san and Gui-zhi-Fu-ling-wan in PC has never been reported. We report their application on a 71-year-old male patient, who was diagnosed with PC and was undergoing endocrine therapy. He originally chose chemotherapy, and experienced acute renal failure, which required hemodialysis during hospitalization. He felt weak and opted for Chinese herbal medicine treatment. After treatment with Shi-pi-san and Gui-zhi-Fu-ling-wan, the patient's tumor and other symptoms were significantly reduced, and he reported feeling \"refreshed.\" This case indicates that TCM treatment has unique advantages and is more tolerable than endocrine therapy and chemotherapy. Considering that the patient was undergoing hemodialysis treatment and using low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) to prevent blood coagulation while taking TCM, whether LMWH has a synergistic anticancer effect remains to be explored.

Two hundred and forty-two patients with at least two biopsy-proven malignancies and had at least 3&#8201;months of follow-up after MPMs diagnosis were included. VTE was diagnosed in 14.5% of the cases, two-thirds of which were deep vein thrombosis. VTE was significantly associated with a higher mortality and worse survival. Predictors of VTE after MPMs diagnosis were a high ECOG performance status at MPMs diagnosis, a metastatic first primary malignancy, and ICU admission after MPMs diagnosis. Having a GI or hematological malignancy as the second primary malignancy, a high D-dimer at ICU admission, and palliative care referral were significantly associated with a higher mortality in patients who had VTE. VTE was diagnosed in 14.5% of patients with MPMs and it significantly compromises their survival.

        "AbstractText": "Ror1 plays a crucial role in cancer progression by regulating cell proliferation and migration. Ror1 is expressed abundantly in various types of cancer cells and cancer stem-like cells. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating expression of Ror1 in these cells remain largely unknown. Ror1 and its putative ligand Wnt5a are expressed highly in malignant gliomas, especially in glioblastomas, and the extents of Ror1 expression are correlated positively with poorer prognosis in patients with gliomas. We show that Ror1 expression can be up-regulated in glioblastoma cells under spheroid culture, but not adherent culture conditions. Notch and hypoxia signaling pathways have been shown to be activated in spheroid-forming glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs), and Ror1 expression in glioblastoma cells are indeed suppressed by inhibiting either Notch or hypoxia signaling. Meanwhile, either forced expression of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) in or hypoxic culture of glioblastoma cells result in enhanced expression of Ror1 in the cells. Consistently, we show that both NICD and HIF1&#945; bind to upstream regions within the Ror1 gene more efficiently in GSCs under spheroid culture conditions. Furthermore, we provide evidence, indicating that binding of Wnt5a to Ror1, up-regulated by Notch and hypoxia signaling pathways in GSCs, might promote their spheroid-forming ability. Collectively, these findings indicate for the first time that Notch and hypoxia signaling pathways can elicit Wnt5a-Ror1 axis through transcriptional activation of Ror1 in glioblastoma cells, thereby promoting their stem cell-like property.

        "AbstractText": "Transketolase (TKT), a key rate-limiting enzyme in the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), provides more than 85% of the ribose required for de novo nucleotide biosynthesis and promotes the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Pharmacologic inhibition of TKT could impede HCC development and enhance treatment efficacy. However, no safe and effective TKT inhibitor has been approved. An online two-dimensional TKT protein immobilised biochromatographic system was established for high-throughput screening of TKT ligands. Oroxylin A was found to specifically bind TKT. Drug affinity responsive target stability, cellular thermal shift assay, surface plasmon resonance, molecular docking, competitive displacement assay, and site mutation were performed to identify the binding of oroxylin A with TKT. Antitumour effects of oroxylin A were evaluated in vitro, in human xenograft mice, diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC mice, and patient-derived organoids (PDOs). Metabolomic analysis was applied to detect the enzyme activity. Transcriptome profiling was conducted to illustrate the anti-HCC mechanism of oroxylin A. TKT knocking-down HCC cell lines and PDOs were established to evaluate the role of TKT in oroxylin A-induced HCC suppression. By targeting TKT, oroxylin A stabilised the protein to proteases and temperature extremes, decreased its activity and expression, resulted in accumulation of non-oxidative PPP substrates, and activated p53 signalling. In addition, oroxylin A suppressed cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest, and inhibited the growth of human xenograft tumours and DEN-induced HCC in mice. Crucially, TKT depletion exerted identical effects to oroxylin A, and the promising inhibitor also exhibited excellent therapeutic efficacy against clinically relevant HCC PDOs. These results uncover a unique role for oroxylin A in TKT inhibition, which directly targets TKT and suppresses the non-oxidative PPP. Our findings will facilitate the development of small-molecule inhibitors of TKT and novel therapeutics for HCC. ",

        "ArticleTitle": "Lesions to both somatic and affective pain pathways lead to decreased salience network connectivity. ",
        "AbstractText": "Human pain is a salient stimulus composed of two main components: a sensory\\somatic component, carrying peripheral nociceptive sensation via the spino-thalamic tract and brainstem nuclei to the thalamus and then to sensory cortical regions, and an affective (suffering) component, where information from central thalamic nuclei is carried to the anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and other regions. While the sensory component processes information about stimulus location and intensity, the affective component processes information regarding pain-related expectations, motivation to reduce pain, and pain unpleasantness. Unlike investigations of acute pain that are based on the introduction of real-time stimulus during brain recordings, chronic pain investigations are usually based on longitudinal and case-control studies, which are limited in their ability to infer the functional network topology of chronic pain. In the current study, we utilized the unique opportunity to target the central nervous system's pain pathways in two different hierarchical locations to establish causality between pain relief and specific connectivity changes seen within the salience and sensorimotor networks. We examined how lesions to the affective and somatic pain pathways affect resting-state network topology in cancer patients suffering from severe intractable pain. Two procedures have been employed: percutaneous cervical cordotomy (n&#8201;=&#8201;15), hypothesized to disrupt the transmission of the sensory component of pain along the spino-thalamic tract, or stereotactic cingulotomy (n&#8201;=&#8201;7), which refers to bilateral intra-cranial ablation of an area in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and is known to ameliorate the affective component of pain. Both procedures led to immediate significant alleviation of experienced pain and decreased functional connectivity within the salience network. However, only the sensory procedure (cordotomy) led to decreased connectivity within the sensorimotor network. Thus, our results support the existence of two converging systems relaying experienced pain, showing that pain-related suffering can be either directly influenced by interfering with the affective pathway, or indirectly influenced by interfering with the ascending spino-thalamic tract.

Hence, this study investigates how recommendations are communicated to patients and the extent to which the interactions with patients in MTCs are in line with shared decision-making (SDM). In this observational study, we audio-recorded MTCs with patient participation in three breast and gynaecologic cancer centres in Germany. We qualitatively analysed the data with regard to content and linguistic aspects. We analysed 82 case discussions. Recommendations made during MTCs were regarding (i) treatment options, (ii) treatment initiation, (iii) next (treatment) steps&#160;and (iv) whether a treatment method should be initiated at all. The decision about recommendations depended in part on patients' preferences or further course/further outcomes. Although the purpose of MTCs is to provide recommendations, some recommendations were framed as the final decision. The majority of the decision-making conversation could be characterized as option talk (78%), during which patients were mostly&#160;proposed only one (treatment) option. This study establishes limited SDM in MTCs with patient participation. By indicating choices and thereby creating awareness of choices among patients, MTCs with patient participation could be used to foster SDM implementation.

Here, translucent zebrafish (Danio rerio) is utilized to demonstrate that genetic knockout or knockdown of one such miR, microRNA-223 (miR223), globally or specifically in leukocytes, does indeed lead to reduced cancer progression. As a first step toward potential translation to a clinical therapy, a novel strategy is described for reprogramming neutrophils and macrophages utilizing miniature artificial protocells (PCs) to deliver anti-miRs against the anti-inflammatory miR223. Using genetic and live imaging approaches, it is shown that phagocytic uptake of anti-miR223-loaded PCs by leukocytes in zebrafish (and by human macrophages in vitro) effectively prolongs their pro-inflammatory state by blocking the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which, in turn, drives altered immune cell-cancer cell interactions and ultimately leads to a reduced cancer burden by driving reduced proliferation and increased cell death of tumor cells. This PC cargo delivery strategy for reprogramming leukocytes toward beneficial phenotypes has implications also for treating other systemic or local immune-mediated pathologies. ",

According to preclinical study results, 99mTc-NTP 15-5, is a good candidate for a specific functional molecular imaging of joints. We intend to initiate a first in-human study to confirm and quantify 99mTc-NTP 15-5 uptake in healthy joints. As the clinical development of this radiotracer would be oriented toward the functional imaging of joint pathologies, we have chosen to include patients with healthy joints (unilateral osteoarthritis of the knee or breast cancer with indication of AI treatment). This phase I study will be an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation trial of a radiopharmaceutical orientation to determine the recommended level of activity of 99mTc-NTP 15-5 to obtain the best joint tracer contrasts on images, without dose limiting toxicity (DLT). The secondary objectives will include the study of the pharmacology, biodistribution (using planar whole body and SPECT-CT acquisitions), toxicity, and dosimetry of this radiotracer. The dose escalation with 3 activity levels (5, 10, and 15 MBq/kg), will be conditioned by the absence at the previous level of DLT and of a visualized tracer accumulation on more than 80% of healthy joints as observed on scintigraphy performed at &#8804; 2 h post-injection.

Plot curves were then generalized to present a non-linear relationship, and the inflection point for each non-linear model was obtained by using a recursive algorithm. Cognitive impairment was more prevalent in CKD patients than in non-CKD subjects. For CKD patients, caffeine intake was associated with higher CERAD-WL, CERAD-DR, AF and DSST scores. For non-CKD subjects, caffeine intake was associated with higher DSST scores only. Subgroup analysis revealed that caffeine only benefited the cognitive function of patients with CKD stages 2 and 3. The analysis showed non-linear relationships of caffeine intake and cognitive function for both CKD and non-CKD subjects. The inflection point of caffeine intake for CKD patients was 279 mg/day. The recommended dose of caffeine intake to improve the cognitive function of CKD patients is &#8804;279 mg/day. ",

        "ArticleTitle": "CXCR5+CD8 T cells: Potential immunotherapy targets or drivers of immune-mediated adverse events? ",
        "AbstractText": "CXCR5+CD8 T cells have attracted significant interest within multiple areas of immunology, cancer, and infection. This is in part due to their apparent dual functionality. These cells perform as cytotoxic cells in a variety of infection states including LCMV, HBV, HIV and SIV. However, CXCR5+CD8 T cells also associate with B cells in peripheral organs and function to stimulate B cell proliferation, antibody/B cell receptor class-switch, and antibody production. CXCR5+CD8 T cells are similar to CXCR5+CD4 T follicular helpers in their genetic make-up, B cell interactions, and functionality despite possessing elevated programmed cell death 1 and cytotoxic proteins. Within cancer CXCR5+CD8 T cells have risen as potential prognostic markers for overall survival and are functionally cytotoxic within tumor microenvironments. In inflammatory disease and autoimmunity, CXCR5+CD8 T cells are implicated in disease progression. During viral infection and cancer, CXCR5 expression on CD8 T cells generally is indicative of progenitor memory stem-like exhausted cells, which are more responsive to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors to overcome immune exhaustion in cancer, and subsequent consequence of immune adverse events, highlights the dual nature of the cellular immune response. This review will detail the functionality of CXCR5+CD8 T cells in cancer and autoimmunity with potential repercussions during immune checkpoint blockade therapy discussed. ",

        "AbstractText": "Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is one of the globally recognized causative factors of gastric cancer (GC). Currently, no definite therapy and drugs for H. pylori-related GC have been widely acknowledged although H. pylori infection could be eradicated in early stage. Inflammation and immune response are spontaneous essential stages during H. pylori infection. H pylori may mediate immune escape by affecting inflammation and immune response, leading to gastric carcinogenesis. As an important component of transcriptome, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been proven to play crucial roles in the genesis and development of H. pylori-induced GC. This review briefly described the effects of ncRNAs on H. pylori-related GC from the perspective of inflammation and immune response, as well as their association with inflammatory reaction and immune microenvironment. We aim to explore the potential of ncRNAs as markers for the early diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of H. pylori-related GC. The ncRNAs involved in H. pylori-related GC may all hold promise as novel therapeutic targets for immunotherapy. ",

        "AbstractText": "Radioimmunoconjugates have been used for over 30 years in nuclear medicine applications. In the last few years, advances in cancer biology knowledge have led to the identification of new molecular targets specific to certain patient subgroups. The use of these targets in targeted therapies approaches has allowed the developments of specifically tailored therapeutics for patients. As consequence of the PET-imaging progresses, nuclear medicine has developed powerful imaging tools, based on monoclonal antibodies, to in vivo characterization of these tumor biomarkers. This imaging modality known as immuno-positron emission tomography (immuno-PET) is currently in fastest-growing and its medical value lies in its ability to give a non-invasive method to assess the in vivo target expression and distribution and provide key-information on the tumor targeting. Currently, immuno-PET presents promising probes for different nuclear medicine topics as staging/stratification tool, theranostic approaches or predictive/prognostic biomarkers. To develop a radiopharmaceutical drug that can be used in immuno-PET approach, it is necessary to find the best compromise between the isotope choice and the immunologic structure (full monoclonal antibody or derivatives). Through some clinical applications, this paper review aims to discuss the most important aspects of the isotope choice and the usable proteic structure that can be used to meet the clinical needs. ",

        "AbstractText": "Axillary lymph node (ALN) involvement in breast cancer (BC) is considered to be a significant factor in determining the diseases' extent at the moment. The spreading capacity of cancerous cells may linearly correlate with its activity level, which in turn alter the coagulation function as commonly represented by fibrin degradation biomarker i.e., D-dimer. Although ALN metastatic status is eventually should be perceptible in physical examinations or other diagnostic modalities, an additional marker to estimate the lymph node extent should be considered in the pre-operative sessions. To provide the correlation between elevated D-dimer level and ALN metastatic status positivity among BC patients. This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Teaching Hospital of Universitas Sumatera Utara by retrieving outpatients' medical records from June 2018 to January 2019, encompassing 111 female patients. The ALN involvement status was recorded along with plasma D-dimer level in which the value of 500 ng/mL was considered to be elevated. From the 102 eligible participants, 47.1% and 70.6% were confirmed with elevated D-dimer level and ALN involved respectively. Further analysis of those variables demonstrated a considerable diagnostic performance for sensitivity (64.4%), specificity (79.1%), PPV (80.9%), NPV (61.8%), accuracy (70.6%) and statistically significant results (P = .001). Elevated D-dimer level may be influenced by cancerous spread capacity in the lymphatic system, as it also eventually correlated with coagulation system dysregulation. Therefore, it is suggested that the role of D-dimer measurement is recommended to be explored further in BC diagnostic workup. ",

        "ArticleTitle": "Targeting K-Ras-mediated DNA damage response in radiation oncology: Current status, challenges and future perspectives. ",
        "AbstractText": "Approximately 60% of cancer patients receive curative or palliative radiation. Despite the significant role of radiotherapy (RT) as a curative approach for many solid tumors, tumor recurrence occurs, partially because of intrinsic radioresistance. Accumulating evidence indicates that the success of RT is hampered by activation of the DNA damage response (DDR). The intensity of DDR signaling is affected by multiple parameters, e.g., loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressor genes, gain-of-function mutations in protooncogenes as well as radiation-induced alterations in signal-transduction pathways. Therefore, the response to irradiation differs in tumors of different types, which makes the individualization of RT as a rational but challenging goal. One contributor to tumor cell radiation survival is signaling through the Ras pathway. Three RAS genes encode 4 Ras isoforms: K-Ras4A, K-Ras4B, H-Ras, and N-Ras. RAS family members are found to be mutated in approximately 19% of human cancers. Mutations in RAS lead to constitutive activation of the gene product and activation of multiple Ras-dependent signal-transduction cascades. Preclinical studies have shown that the expression of mutant KRAS affects DDR and increases cell survival after irradiation. Approximately 70% of RAS mutations occur in KRAS. Thus, applying targeted therapies directly against K-Ras as well as K-Ras upstream activators and downstream effectors might be a tumor-specific approach to overcome K-Ras-mediated RT resistance. In this review, the role of K-Ras in the activation of DDR signaling will be summarized. Recent progress in targeting DDR in KRAS-mutated tumors in combination with radiochemotherapy will be discussed. ",

In total, 120 cervical cancer tissues, as well as 20 samples each of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs), and benign cervical tissue, were collected to evaluate the expression of C1QB protein via immunohistochemical staining. We conducted an integrated analysis of C1QB mRNA expression in cervical cancer using public microarrays and RNA-seq data sets by calculating standard mean differences (SMDs). Simultaneously, we explored the relations of C1QB with clinicopathological parameters and the expression of P16, Ki-67, and P53. The expression of C1QB protein was higher in cervical cancer samples than that in benign cervical tissue, LSIL, and HSIL samples (p < 0.05). A combined SMD of 0.65 (95% CI: [0.52, 0.79], p < 0.001) revealed upregulation of C1QB mRNA in cervical cancer. C1QB expression may also be related to the depth of infiltration, lymphovascular invasion, and perineural invasion in cervical cancer (p < 0.05). We also found that C1QB protein expression was positively correlated with P16 and Ki-67 expression in cervical cancer (p < 0.05). The gene set enrichment analysis showed that C1QB may participate in apoptosis and autophagy. A relationship was predicted between C1QB expression and drug sensitivity to cisplatin, paclitaxel, and docetaxel. We confirmed the overexpression of C1QB in cervical cancer at both mRNA and protein levels for the first time.

However, the clinical significance of amino acid transporting SLC members in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) remains unclear. This study aimed to develop an SLC family-based model to predict the prognosis and the response of STAD patients to immunotherapy. Methods: A total of 1239 tumor cases were obtained from online databases. The training set (n = 371) consisted of RNA sequencing profiles obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), while those from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were used as the test set. Subsequently, the clinical characteristics and immune profiles were investigated, and potential immunotherapy response prediction values of the model were assessed. Results: Based on the TCGA cohort, an SLC family-based model was developed using multivariate Cox analysis. All tumor cases were stratified into high- and low-risk groups considering the SLC model. High-risk patients had a worse overall survival (OS) than low-risk patients, consistent with the results of GEO cohorts. Comprehensive analyses revealed that the high-risk group was correlated with aggressiveness-related pathways, whereas the low-risk group had better T helper cell infiltration and stronger immunotherapy response. Compared to the high-risk group, the low-risk group presented increased PD-L1 and tumor mutation burden. Conclusion: This SLC family-based model has the potential to predict the prognosis and immunotherapy outcomes of STAD patients. The survival of patients in the low-risk group was greatly prolonged, and the patients may benefit more from immunotherapy. ",

The aim of this study is to outline the theoretical process behind development of CanMOVE, a behavior change intervention designed to increase physical activity for children and adolescents with cancer. This study followed a theoretical design process consistent with the Behavior Change Wheel to inform the design of a complex intervention. The three stages of the Behavior Change Wheel intervention design process include: (1) understanding physical activity behavior within the pediatric cancer setting, (2) identifying potential intervention functions, and (3) identifying appropriate behavior change and implementation strategies. Qualitative and behavior change literature relevant to the pediatric cancer treatment setting were used to inform each stage. An individualized and flexible approach to physical activity promotion that considers intrinsic factors specific to the child/adolescent and their environment is required. Fifteen behavioral change strategies were identified to form the intervention components of CanMOVE. Implementation strategies were identified to build motivation, opportunity and capacity toward increasing physical activity behaviors. Key intervention components of CanMOVE include standardized assessment and monitoring (physical activity, physical function, and health-related quality of life), provision of an activity monitor to both child/adolescent and parent, and one-on-one capacity building sessions with a healthcare professional. Capacity building sessions include education, goal setting, an active supervised physical activity session, barrier identification and problem solving, and action planning. CanMOVE is a novel approach to physical activity promotion in the pediatric cancer treatment setting. The use of a theoretical intervention design process will aid evaluation and replication of CanMOVE when it is assessed for feasibility in a clinical setting.

Alternative donors include Cord Blood as well as HLA-mismatched unrelated or related donors. If the goal is to minimize the number of HLA disparities, partially matched unrelated donors are more likely to share 8 or 9 of 10 HLA alleles with the recipient. However, over the last decade, there has been success with haploidentical HCT performed using the stem cells from HLA half-matched related donors. As the majority of patients have at least one eligible and motivated haploidentical donor, recruitment of haploidentical related donors is frequently more rapid than of unrelated donors. This advantage in the accessibility has historically been offset by the increased risks of graft rejection, graft-versus-host disease and delayed immune reconstitution. Various ex vivo T-cell depletion (TCD) methods have been investigated to overcome the immunological barrier and facilitate immune reconstitution after a haploidentical HCT. This review summarizes historical and contemporary clinical trials of haploidentical TCD-HCT, mainly in pediatric malignancy, and describes the evolution of these approaches with a focus on serial improvements in the kinetics of immune reconstitution. Methods of TCD discussed include in vivo as well as ex vivo positive and negative selection. In addition, haploidentical TCD as a platform for post-HCT cellular therapies is discussed. The present review highlights that, as a result of the remarkable progress over half a century, haploidentical TCD-HCT can now be considered as a preferred alternative donor option for children with hematological malignancy in need of allogeneic HCT.

Here, we report an extremely rare case of LM with an atypical MR image revealing tumor mass confinement to the arachnoid membrane. The case involves an 85-year-old man who was referred to our hospital with a three-day history of dysarthria. Radiological examination revealed a solid lesion with heterogeneous enhancement and a cystic component in the extra-axial region of the right parietal lobe. Upon subsequent general examination, multiple lung cancer metastases were suspected. The patient underwent gross total resection of the brain mass in the right parietal region. Although the tumor slightly adhered to the dura mater, it was sharply demarcated from the surrounding parenchyma and pia mater. Based on pathological examination, the tumor was diagnosed as small cell lung cancer metastasis. This metastatic brain tumor was exclusively confined to the arachnoid membrane and, except for a few blood vessels, the dura mater was not infiltrated by metastatic tumor cells.

RD was not observed in all groups until 25 days after X-ray irradiation. Skin temperature tended to increase in all groups regardless of irradiation or skin care. However, unlike the control group, the measured value of TEWL in the no skin care group tended to increase in the days after the X-ray irradiation. On the other hand, TEWL was increased in the skin care group compared with the no skin care group a few days after X-ray irradiation. While TEWL was constant in the moisturizer group, the skin washing groups showed an increasing tendency of TEWL and it reached a peak at 13 days after X-ray irradiation. These results suggested that the decrease in skin barrier function was caused by X-ray irradiation and also that skin washing could contribute to the deterioration of skin barrier function after X-ray irradiation.

        "AbstractText": "The correlation between benign thyroid disease (BTD) and breast cancer (BC) has long been discussed. However, the definite relationship and potential mechanism between them are still disputed. The current meta-analysis aimed at performing a comprehensive assessment of the relationship between different types of benign thyroid disease and the risk of breast cancer, furthermore, assessing whether benign thyroid disease exerts an influence on the aggressiveness of breast cancer. A systematic literature search (PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, and Embase databases) identified studies to evaluate the correlation between BTD and BC risk. Data were analyzed using version 16.0 STATA software, including the odds ratio (OR) and its corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Publication bias and quality assessment were conducted for the included studies. Overall, 18 studies involving 422,384 patients with BTD were incorporated. The outcome showed that autoimmune thyroiditis (OR: 2.56, 95%CI: 1.95-3.37, I2 = 0.0%, p=0.460), goiter (OR: 2.13, 95%CI: 1.19-3.79, I2 = 80.6%, p=0.000), and Graves' disease (OR: 5.01, 95%CI: 1.49-16.82, I2 = 0.0%, p=0.358) was connected with a higher risk of BC. Both hypothyroidism (OR: 0.82, 95%CI: 0.64-1.04, I2 = 85.0%, p=0.000) and hyperthyroidism (OR: 1.07, 95%CI: 0.93-1.24, I2 = 24.9%, p=0.206) had no significant association with the risk of BC. Additionally, the pooled analysis showed no apparent correlation between BTD and aggressiveness of BC. However, subgroup analysis indicated a positive relationship between BTD and aggressiveness of BC in the Europe subgroup (HR: 2.05, 95%CI: 1.32-3.17, I2 = 86.4%, p=0.000). Autoimmune thyroiditis, goiter, and Graves' disease are connected with an increased risk of BC. Furthermore, subgroup analysis suggested that BTD increases the aggressiveness of BC in the European population geographically. Nevertheless, further research is needed to prove these discoveries. ",

        "AbstractText": "Ferroptosis is widely involved in the occurrence and development of various cancers, but a specific mechanism involving ferroptosis in cervical cancer is still unclear. Based on the expressions of ferroptosis-related genes, a prognostic model was constructed using lasso regression, and the overall predictive performance of this model was verified. An in-depth analysis of the prognostic model was then conducted. The prognostic model showed good predictive performance in both the validation and test sets. Mechanism analysis indicated that differences in the tumor microenvironment were the basis of the predictive ability of the model. Notably, CA9 mRNA was significantly overexpressed in cervical carcinoma, tissues but not in normal cervix tissues. A pair of ceRNAs (CA9/ULBP2) could be involved in the carcinogenesis and development of cervical cancer, and the potential target might be hsa-miR-34a. In addition, predicted miRNAs and drugs for these DEGs were identified. We constructed a prognostic model with good predictive performance, based on the expression of ferroptosis-related genes. Further research found that the ceRNA pairs of ULBP2/CA9 could regulate cervical cancer through hsa-miR-34a. These results identified the mechanism of ferroptosis in cervical cancer, and might provide novel therapeutics for cervical cancer patients. ",

        "AbstractText": "To investigate the relationship between baseline clinicopathological and laboratory variables especially hematological parameters and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP). We retrospectively evaluated 348 prostate cancer (PCa) patients who underwent RP in our center between May 2018 and June 2021. We divided them into non-LVI and LVI groups based on LVI status, and compared clinicopathological characteristics between non-LVI and LVI groups. Clinicopathological parameters including age, body mass index (BMI), history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (NHT), pathological stage T (pT) and lymph node status (pN), ISUP (international society of urological pathology) grade, positive surgical margin (PSM) rate, and hematological parameters containing prostate-specific antigen (PSA), whole blood parameters and inflammatory indexes were collected. The association between the clinicopathological parameters and the presence of LVI was identified by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The pathological results of the RP specimen consisted of 53 (15.2%) patients with LVI and 295 (84.8%) cases without LVI. The level of PSA, percentages of advanced pT and grade, pN1, and PSM were significantly higher in the LVI group when compared with the non-LVI counterpart (p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.007, respectively). Among the whole blood parameters, only red cell distribution width (RDW) was significantly different (41.2 &#177; 2.5 vs. 42.1 &#177; 3.1, p=0.035). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that RDW and NHT were negatively correlated with the presence of LVI (OR = 0.870, p=0.024; OR = 0.410, p=0.025), while PSA, ISUP, and pT were positively correlated with the presence of LVI (OR=1.013, p=0.005; OR =1.589, p=0.001; OR=1.655, p=0.008) after adjusting for confounding factors. RDW rather than other whole blood parameters was independently and negatively associated with the presence of LVI in PCa patients, suggesting that RDW might play an essential role in PCa invasion. ",

        "AbstractText": "Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression therapy is one of the common treatments for most patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Unfortunately, its detrimental effects on bone health are receiving increasing attention. It may increase the risk of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures. The trabecular bone score (TBS) is a relatively new gray-scale texture measurement parameter that reflects bone microarchitecture and bone strength and has been shown to independently predict fracture risk. We reviewed for the first time the scientific literature on the use of TBS in DTC patients on TSH suppression therapy and aim to analyze and compare the utility of TBS with bone mass strength (BMD) in the management of skeletal health and prediction of fracture risk. We screened a total of seven relevant publications, four of which were for postmenopausal female patients and three for all female patients. Overall, postmenopausal female patients with DTC had lower TBS and a significant reduction in TBS after receiving TSH suppression therapy, but their BMD did not appear to change significantly. In addition, TBS was also found to be an independent predictor of osteoporotic fracture risk in postmenopausal women with DTC receiving TSH suppression therapy. However, due to limitations in the number of studies and study populations, this evidence is not sufficient to fully demonstrate the adverse effects of TSH suppression therapy on patients' TBS or BMD and the efficacy of TBS, and subsequent larger and more case-cohort studies are needed to further investigate the relationship and application of TBS to TSH suppression therapy in terms of skeletal health impairment and fracture risk in DTC patients.

        "AbstractText": "The cAMP-signaling cancers, which are defined by functionally-significant somatic mutations in one or more elements of the cAMP signaling pathway, have an unexpectedly wide range of cell origins, clinical manifestations, and potential therapeutic options. Mutations in at least 9 cAMP signaling pathway genes (TSHR, GPR101, GNAS, PDE8B, PDE11A, PRKARA1, PRKACA, PRKACB, and CREB) have been identified as driver mutations in human cancer. Although all cAMP-signaling pathway cancers are driven by mutation(s) that impinge on a single signaling pathway, the ultimate tumor phenotype reflects interactions between five critical variables: (1) the precise gene(s) that undergo mutation in each specific tumor type; (2) the effects of specific allele(s) in any given gene; (3) mutations in modifier genes (mutational \"context\"); (4) the tissue-specific expression of various cAMP signaling pathway elements in the tumor stem cell; and (5) and the precise biochemical regulation of the pathway components in tumor cells. These varying oncogenic mechanisms reveal novel and important targets for drug discovery. There is considerable diversity in the \"druggability\" of cAMP-signaling components, with some elements (GPCRs, cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases and kinases) appearing to be prime drug candidates, while other elements (transcription factors, protein-protein interactions) are currently refractory to robust drug-development efforts. Further refinement of the precise driver mutations in individual tumors will be essential for directing priorities in drug discovery efforts that target these mutations. ",

Hence, we investigated the clinical outcomes in patients with moderate-risk PTC following surgery and the first 131I therapy, as well as the relevant factors that influence the therapeutic efficacy. Retrospective analyses of 175 patients with medium-risk PTC who visited the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from September 2017 to April 2019 were conducted. In according with the 2015 American Thyroid Association (ATA) guideline treatment response evaluation system, the patients were categorized into the following groups: excellent response (ER), indeterminate response (IDR), biochemical incomplete response (BIR), and structurally incomplete response (SIR), of which IDR, BIR, and SIR were collectively referred to as the NER group. To compare the general clinical features between the 2 groups of patients, 2 independent samples t-tests, &#967;2 test, and Mann-Whitney U-test were performed, followed by multivariate logistic regression analyses. With reference to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the predicted value of ps-Tg to ER was evaluated, and the best cut-off value was determined. The subgroups with BRAFV600E test results were analyzed by &#967;2 test only. The treatment responses of 123 patients were ER, while those of 52 patients were NER. The differences in the maximum tumor diameter (U = 2495.50), the amount of metastatic lymph nodes (U = 2313.50), the size of metastatic lymph node (U = 2113.50), the metastatic lymph node ratio (U = 2111.50), metastatic lymph node location (&#967;2 = 9.20), and ps-Tg level (U = 1011.00) were statistically significant.

The current management of PTMC has become more conservative; however, there are high-risk tumor features that can be revealed only postoperatively. For thyroid cancer, BRAF mutations and somatic copy number variation (CNV) are the most common genetic events. Molecular testing may contribute to clinical decision-making by molecular risk stratification, for example predicting lymph node (LN) metastasis. Here, we build a risk stratification model based on molecular profiling of thyroid fine needle aspiration (FNA) washout DNA (wDNA) for the differential diagnosis of thyroid nodules. Fifty-eight patients were recruited, FNA wDNA samples were analyzed using CNV profiling through low-coverage whole genome sequencing (LC-WGS) and BRAF mutation was analyzed using quantitative PCR. FNA pathology was reported as a Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (BSRTC) score. Ultrasound examination produced a Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TIRADS) score. In total, 37 (63.8%) patients with a TIRADS score of 4A, 13 (22.4%) patients with a TIRADS score of 4B, and 8 (13.8%) patients with a TIRADS score of 4C were recruited after ultrasound examination. All patients underwent FNA with wDNA profiling. CNVs were identified in 17 (29.3%) patients. CNVs were frequent in patients with a BSRTC score of V or VI, including eight (47.1%) patients with a score of VI and five (29.4%) with a score of V, but not in patients with a score of III, II, or I (0%). BRAF mutation was not significantly correlated with BSRTC score. LN metastasis was found more frequently in CNV-positive (CNV+) than in CNV-negative (CNV-) patients (85.7% vs. 34.6%, odds ratio&#160;=&#160;11.33, p&#160;=&#160;0.002). In total, three molecular subtypes of thyroid nodules were identified in this study: 1) CNV+, 2) CNV- and BRAF positive (BRAF+), and 3) CNV- and BRAF negative (BRAF-). For the CNV+ subtype, 10 (83.3%) lesions with LN metastasis were found, including four (100%) small lesions (i.e. &#8804;&#160;5&#160;mm). For the CNV- and BRAF+ nodules, LN metastases were detected in only seven (60.0%) larger tumors (i.e. >&#160;5&#160;mm). For CNV- and BRAF- tumors, LN metastasis was also frequently found in larger tumors only. It is feasible to identify high-risk LN metastasis thyroid cancer from FNA washout samples preoperatively using wDNA CNV profiling using LC-WGS. ",

The early diagnostic accuracy of CRC is low, and the metastasis rate is high, resulting in a low survival rate of advanced patients. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a small class of noncoding RNAs that can inhibit mRNA translation and trigger mRNA degradation, and can affect a variety of cellular and molecular targets. Numerous studies have shown that miRNAs are related to tumour progression, immune system activity, anticancer drug resistance, and the tumour microenvironment. Dysregulation of miRNAs occurs in a variety of malignancies, including CRC. In this review, we summarize the recent research progress of miRNAs, their roles in tumour progression and metastasis, and their clinical value as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets for CRC. Furthermore, we combined the roles of miRNAs in tumorigenesis and development with the therapeutic strategies of CRC patients, which will provide new ideas for the diagnosis and treatment of CRC. ",

Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), achieved initial success in advanced solid tumors, while their efficacy and safety in advanced or metastatic cervical cancer remains to be explored. Previous studies found high-risk HPV infection and elevated PD-L1 expression in cervical precancerous lesions and squamous cell carcinoma. Meanwhile, elevated PD-L1 expression, high cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration, and abnormal cytotoxic T lymphocyte function might benefit inflammation infiltration for ICIs in the tumor microenvironment. Patients with HPV infection, squamous cell carcinoma, advanced stage, large tumor size, poor differentiation, metastatic disease, history of multiple childbirth and abortion, or a previous history of receiving chemotherapy might be associated with positive PD-L1 expression. Although there is no correlation between PD-L1 expression and prognosis using conventional radiotherapy, patients with high PD-L1 expression have a poorer prognosis. Several clinical studies demonstrate preliminary safety and efficacy for PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, and the exploration of combination strategies such as immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, anti-angiogenesis therapy, or dual ICIs is ongoing.

New technologies with enhanced sensitivity and specificity for early diagnosis and monitoring of postoperative recurrence are in critical demand. Automatic breast full volume scanning system (ABVS) is an emerging technology used as an alternative imaging method for breast cancer screening. Despite its improved detection rate of malignant tumors, ABVS cannot accurately stage breast cancer preoperatively in 30-40% of cases. As a major hallmark of breast cancer, the characteristic metabolic reprogramming may provide potential biomarkers as an auxiliary method for ABVS. The objective of this study was to identify differential metabolomic signatures between benign and malignant breast tumors and among different subtypes of breast cancer patients based on untargeted metabolomics and improve breast cancer detection rate by combining key metabolites and ABVS. Untargeted metabolomics approach was used to profile serum samples from 70 patients with different subtypes of breast cancer and benign breast tumor to determine specific metabolomic profiles through univariate and multivariate statistical data analysis. Metabolic profiles correctly distinguished benign and malignant breast tumors patients, and a total of 791 metabolites were identified. There were 54 different metabolites between benign and malignant breast tumors and 17 different metabolites between invasive and non-invasive breast cancer. Notably, the missed diagnosis rate of ABVS could be reduced by differential metabolite analysis. Moreover, the diagnostic performance analyses of combined metabolites (pelargonic acid, N-acetylasparagine, and cysteine-S-sulfate) with ABVS performance gave a ROC area under the curve of 0.967 (95% CI: 0.926, 0.993). Our study identified metabolic features both in benign and malignant breast tumors and in invasive and non-invasive breast cancer. Combined ultrasound ABVS and a panel of differential serum metabolites could further improve the accuracy of preoperative diagnosis of breast cancer and guide surgical therapy. ",

In our study, the prognostic value of immune-related lncRNAs was investigated in OC patients from TCGA-RNA-seq cohort (n=378) and HG-U133_Plus_2 cohort (n=590), respectively. Pearson correlation analysis was implemented to screen the immune-related lncRNA and then univariate Cox regression analysis was performed to explore their prognostic value in OC patients. Five prognostic immune-related lncRNAs were identified as prognostic lncRNAs. Besides, they were inputted into a LASSO Cox regression to establish and validate an immune-related lncRNA prognostic signature in TCGA-RNA-Seq cohort and HG-U133_Plus_2 cohort, respectively. Based on the best cut-off value of risk score, patients were divided into high- and low-risk groups. Survival analysis suggested that patients in the high-risk group had a worse overall survival (OS) than those in the low-risk group in both cohorts. The association between clinicopathological feathers and risk score was then evaluated by using stratification analysis. Moreover, we constructed a nomogram based on risk score, age and stage, which had a strong ability to forecast the OS of the OC patients. The influence of risk score on immune infiltration and immunotherapy response were assessed and the results suggested that patients with high-risk score might recruit multiple immune cells and stromal cells, leading to facilitating immune surveillance evasive. Ultimately, we demonstrated that the risk model was associated with chemotherapy response of multiple antitumor drugs, especially for paclitaxel, metformin and veliparib, which are commonly used in treating OC patients. In conclusion, we constructed a novel immune-related lncRNA signature, which had a potential prognostic value for OC patients and might facilitate personalized counselling for immunotherapy and chemotherapy.

        "ArticleTitle": "Radiolabeled EGFR TKI as predictive imaging biomarkers in NSCLC patients - an overview. ",
        "AbstractText": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has one of the highest cancer-related mortality rates worldwide. In a subgroup of NSCLC, tumor growth is driven by epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) that harbor an activating mutation. These patients are best treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKI). Identifying the EGFR mutational status on a tumor biopsy or a liquid biopsy using tumor DNA sequencing techniques is the current approach to predict tumor response on EGFR TKI therapy. However, due to difficulty in reaching tumor sites, and varying inter- and intralesional tumor heterogeneity, biopsies are not always possible or representative of all tumor lesions, highlighting the need for alternative biomarkers that predict tumor response. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies using EGFR TKI-based tracers have shown that EGFR mutational status could be identified, and that tracer uptake could potentially be used as a biomarker for tumor response. However, despite their likely predictive and monitoring value, the EGFR TKI-PET biomarkers are not yet qualified to be used in the routine clinical practice. In this review, we will discuss the currently investigated EGFR-directed PET biomarkers, elaborate on the typical biomarker development process, and describe how the advances, challenges, and opportunities of EGFR PET biomarkers relate to this process on their way to qualification for routine clinical practice.

        "AbstractText": "Surgery is the main curative therapeutic strategy for patients with initial primary lung cancer (IPLC). Most international guidelines recommend regular follow-ups after discharge to monitor patients for tumor recurrence and metastasis. As the overall survival (OS) in patients with lung cancer improves, their risk of secondary primary lung cancer (SPLC) increases. Previous studies on such patients lack separate assessment of different survival outcomes and evaluation of high-risk factors for SPLC. Therefore, we aimed to determine the correlation between high-risk factors and causes of death in patients with SPLC, based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. We screened the SEER database for patients with IPLC and SPLC from 2004 to 2015 and included only patients who underwent surgery since the IPLC and in whom the cancer was pathologically verified of an International Classification of Diseases grade of 0-3 and to be non-small-cell lung cancer. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated between variables and SPLC. Multivariable Cox proportional-hazards regression analyses were conducted to calculate the correlation of different variables with overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). A competing-risk model was conducted for SPLC. The effect of baseline bias on survival outcomes by performing propensity score matching analysis in a 1: 6 ratio (SPLC: IPLC). For patients aged 0-49 years, the overall SIR was higher in older patients, reaching a maximum of 27.74 in those aged 40-49 years, and at 11.63 in patients aged 50-59 years. The overall SIR was higher for patients who were more recently diagnosed with IPLC and increased with time after diagnosis. Male sex, SPLC (hazard ratio, 1.6173; 95% confidence interval, 1.5505-1.6869; P < 0.001), cancer grade III or IV, lower lobe of the lung, advanced stage and postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) were independently detrimental to OS. In terms of CSS, PORT was a high-risk factor. Postoperative radiotherapy is a risk factor for second primary lung cancer and detrimental to overall and cancer-specific survival in patients who had initial primary lung cancer. These data support the need for life-long follow-up of patients who undergo treatment for IPLC to screen for SPLC. ",

Immunotherapy targeting checkpoints have revolutionized the management of ccRCC, but a sustained clinical response is achieved in only a minority of ccRCC patients. This indicates that our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the malignant transition and resistance to immune checkpoint therapy in ccRCC is unclear. This review examines recent single-cell transcriptomics studies of ccRCC to clarify the transition of PTEC in ccRCC development, and the immune cell types, states, and interactions that may limit the response to targeted immune therapy, and finally suggests stromal cells as key drivers in recurrent and locally invasive ccRCC. These and future single-cell transcriptomics studies will continue to clarify the cellular milieu in the ccRCC microenvironment, thus defining actional clinical, therapeutic, and prognostic characteristics of ccRCC.

The study objective was to determine whether GCP-II targeted imaging with 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT can detect disease sites in women with advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). Twenty treatment-na&#239;ve women with advanced HGSOC were recruited (median age 60 years). Prior to commencing therapy (primary cytoreductive surgery [n=9] or neoadjuvant chemotherapy [n=11]), subjects underwent routine staging with contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT (=CT), followed by 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT (=PET). CT and PET were reported independently using a standardized reporting template assessing 25 sites. The performance of PET was compared to CT in all subjects and to surgery and surgical histopathology in 9 patients who underwent primary cytoreductive surgery. Of the 25 sites assessed in 20 patients, CT detected disease in 292/500 (58.4%) locations and PET detected disease in 171/500 (34.2%). Compared to CT the sensitivity (95% CI) of PET to detect disease in the upper abdomen, the gastrointestinal tract or the peritoneum was 0.29 (0.20,0.40), 0.21 (0.11,0.33) and 0.74 (0.64,0.82), respectively. In the surgical cohort, 220 sites in 9 patients were evaluated. The sensitivity and specificity of CT and PET were 0.85 versus 0.54 (p<0.001) and 0.73 versus 0.93 (p<0.001), respectively. Although 18F-DCFPyL has higher specificity than CT in detecting advanced HGSOC tumor sites, it detects less disease sites than CT, especially in the upper abdomen and along the gastrointestinal tract, likely limiting its clinical utility.

The clinicopathologic relevance and prognostic impact of LVI were retrospectively analyzed in 822 patients with surgically treated ESCC. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine the independent prognostic factors. Subgroup analyses stratified by pathological stages, nodal status and invasive depth were conducted using Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Multiple staging models based on overall survival (OS) were constructed using Cox regression and evaluated by Harrell's concordance index (C-index), integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), and net reclassification index (NRI). LVI was detected in 24.6% of ESCC patients, and its prevalence increased with a higher pathological stage (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, LVI was found to be an independent prognostic factor for OS [Hazard ratio (HR) = 1.545, 95% CI, 1.201-1.986), and was associated with unfavorable outcomes in stage I to III ESCC, regardless of nodal status and invasive depth.

Self-report of cognitive complaints and fatigue were prospectively assessed 7 &#177; 3 years after therapy. Metabolic changes were estimated with i) robust mixed-effects modelling in regions-of-interest (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, and insular cortex) and ii) general-linear modelling of whole-brain voxel-wise outcomes. iii) The association between metabolic changes and self-reported outcomes was evaluated using linear regression-analysis. Of the 667 screened patients, 263 underwent PET/CT before and after chemotherapy and 183 (48 &#177; 9 years) met the inclusion criteria. After chemotherapy, decreased frontal and increased parietal and insular metabolism were observed (|&#223;|>0.273, pFDR <0.008).

However, there is no summary of ferroptosis-related LncRNA and its functions in melanoma. In the present study, we aim to explore the expression profile of ferroptosis-related LncRNA genes and their value in melanoma prognosis by bioinformatics analysis. The expression of ferroptosis-related gene (FRG) from melanoma clinical data was extracted based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. By screening the RNA expression data of 472 cases of melanoma and 810 cases of normal skin, eighteen ferroptosis-related differential genes were found to be related to the overall survival rate. Furthermore, 384 ferroptosis-related LncRNAs were discovered through constructing the mRNA-LncRNA co-expression network, and ten of them were found with prognostic significance in melanoma by multivariate Cox analysis. Risk assessment showed that the high expression of LncRNA00520 is associated with poor prognosis, while the increased expression of the other LncRNA is beneficial to the prognosis of patients with melanoma. From univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, there were ten ferroptosis-related LncRNA risk models towards to be significant independent prognostic factors for patients with melanoma and valuable predictive factors for overall survival (OS)(P<0.05). The ROC curve further suggested that the risk score has relatively reliable predictive ability (AUC=0.718).

        "AbstractText": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) frequently has a dysregulated epigenome causing aberrant up-regulation of oncogenes such as c-MYC. Bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins and histone acetyltransferases (HAT) are epigenetic regulatory proteins that create and maintain epigenetic states supporting oncogenesis. BET inhibitors and HAT inhibitors are currently being investigated as cancer therapeutics due to their ability to suppress cancer-promoting epigenetic modifiers. Due to the extensive molecular crosstalk between BET proteins and HAT proteins, we hypothesized that dual inhibition of BET and HAT could more potently inhibit CRC cells than inhibition of each individual protein. We investigated the activity and mechanisms of a dual BET and HAT inhibitor, NEO2734, in CRC cell lines and mouse xenografts. MTS, flow cytometry, and microscopy were used to assess cell viability. qPCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescent staining were used to assess mechanisms of action. We found that NEO2734 more potently suppresses CRC cell growth than first generation BET inhibitors, regardless of the status of common CRC driver mutations. We previously showed that BET inhibitors upregulate DR5 to induce extrinsic apoptosis. In the current study, we show that NEO2734 treatment induces CRC cell apoptosis via both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways. NEO2734 increases p53 expression and subsequently increased expression of the p53-upregulated mediator of apoptosis (PUMA), which is a critical mechanism for activating intrinsic apoptosis. We demonstrate that inhibition of either the intrinsic or extrinsic branches of apoptosis partially rescues CRC cells from NEO2734 treatment, while the dual inhibition of both branches of apoptosis more strongly rescues CRC cells from NEO2734 treatment. Finally, we show that NEO2734 monotherapy is able to suppress tumor growth in CRC xenografts by inducing apoptosis. Our study demonstrates NEO2734 potently suppresses CRC cells in vitro and in vivo by simultaneously upregulating PUMA and DR5 to induce cell death. Further studies of NEO2734 for treating CRC are warranted. ",

Biochemical failure was defined according to the criteria used in each raw study. The presence of any cancer on follow-up biopsy was classified as \"positive biopsy\". Patients able to penetrate their partner without pharmacologic support were rated potent. Meta-analysis was performed to evaluate functional outcomes using R project. A total of 1861 patients in 15 eligible studies were included. All studies were identified as moderate or high quality. There were 1388 (74.6%) patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk PCa in 15 studies and 473 (25.4%) patients with high-risk PCa in 12 studies. The mean PSA nadir postoperatively ranged from 0.20 to 1.90 ng/mL within average time of 1.9-12 months.

Eleven studies reported the rates of positive biopsy ranged from 3% to 29.7% within average time of 3-12 months postoperatively. Based on the results of single-arm meta-analysis, the pooled rates of any degree urinary incontinence, acute urinary retention, urinary tract infections, and urethral stricture were 9.4% (95% CI: 6.1%-12.6%), 0.9% (95% CI: 0%-2%), 2.6% (95% CI: 0.8%-4.3%), and 4.3% (95% CI: 1.4%-7.1%), respectively.

One of the ways in which the body maintains homeostasis is programmed cell death, which includes apoptosis, autophagic cell death, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, NETosis, and the more recently identified process of cuprotosis. Evasion of these cell deaths is a hallmark of cancer cells, and our elucidation of the way these cells die helps us better understands the mechanisms by which cancer arises and provides us with more ways to treat it.Studies have shown that programmed cell death requires wild-type p53 protein and that mutations of TP53 can affect these modes of programmed cell death. For example, mutant p53 promotes iron-dependent cell death in ferroptosis and inhibits apoptotic and autophagic cell death. It is clear that TP53 mutations act on more than one pathway to death, and these pathways to death do not operate in isolation. They interact with each other and together determine cell death. This review focuses on the mechanisms via which TP53 mutation affects programmed cell death.

Third, an immune risk score (IRS) was developed to predict the prognosis. Finally, the immunological relationship of MARCH1 in pan-cancer was also estimated. We found that E3s were disordered in LUAD. Among them, MARCH1 was positively correlated with most immunological characteristics, indicating that MARCH1 designed an inflamed TME in LUAD. Coincidently, LUAD with low MARCH1 expression had a poor prognosis and was not sensitive to immune checkpoint blockers. In addition, the IRS could accurately predict the prognosis.

        "AbstractText": "There are few studies on young patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This study aims to explore the metastasis pattern and prognosis of young patients with MBC. A total of 6,336 MBC patients diagnosed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 2010 to 2015 were selected. They were divided into two age groups: the younger group (&#8804;40 years old) and the older group (>40 years old). &#967;2 test was used to compare clinicopathological characteristics. Survival differences were compared by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Cox regression models were used to determine the prognostic factors affecting survival. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to balance the effects of baseline clinicopathological differences. Finally, 494 patients (7.8%) who are &#8804;40 years old and 5,842 patients (92.2%) who are >40 years old were included. In the younger group, the proportion of liver metastasis was significantly higher than that in the older group; the proportion of lung metastasis was significantly lower than that of the older group. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the younger group had the best prognosis and the older group had the worst. Youth is an independent protective factor for overall survival (OS). In the younger group, liver metastasis had the best prognosis among all metastatic sites, and the HER2-enriched subtype had the best prognosis among all subtypes. The disease in young MBC patients is more aggressive but has a better prognosis, especially in liver metastases and the HER2-enriched subtypes. ",

        "AbstractText": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) models with magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) in predicting pathological complete response(pCR) to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in patients with rectal cancer. Furthermore, assessed the methodological quality of the models. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of science for studies published before 21 June 2022, without any language restrictions. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) and Radiomics Quality Score (RQS) tools were used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. We calculated pooled sensitivity and specificity using random-effects models, I2 values were used to measure heterogeneity, and subgroup analyses to explore potential sources of heterogeneity. We selected 21 papers for inclusion in the meta-analysis from 1562 retrieved publications, with a total of 1873 people in the validation groups. The meta-analysis showed that AI models based on MRI predicted pCR to nCRT in patients with rectal cancer: a pooled area under the curve (AUC) 0.91 (95% CI, 0.88-0.93), sensitivity of 0.82(95% CI,0.71-0.90), pooled specificity 0.86(95% CI,0.80-0.91). In the subgroup analysis, the pooled AUC of the deep learning(DL) model was 0.97, the pooled AUC of the radiomics model was 0.85; the pooled AUC of the combined model with clinical factors was 0.92, and the pooled AUC of the radiomics model alone was 0.87. The mean RQS score of the included studies was 10.95, accounting for 30.4% of the total score. Radiomics is a promising noninvasive method with high value in predicting pathological response to nCRT in patients with rectal cancer. DL models have higher predictive accuracy than radiomics models, and combined models incorporating clinical factors have higher diagnostic accuracy than radiomics models alone. In the future, prospective, large-scale, multicenter investigations using radiomics approaches will strengthen the diagnostic power of pCR. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier CRD42021285630.

        "AbstractText": "Diabetes mellitus often results in several complications, such as diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and end-stage renal diseases (ESRDs). Cancer patients often have the dysregulated glucose metabolism. Abnormal glucose metabolism can enhance the tumor malignant progression. Recently, lncRNAs have been reported to regulate the key proteins and signaling pathways in DKD development and progression and in cancer patients with diabetes. In this review article, we elaborate the evidence to support the function of lncRNAs in development of DKD and diabetes-associated cancer. Moreover, we envisage that lncRNAs could be diagnosis and prognosis biomarkers for DKD and cancer patients with diabetes. Furthermore, we delineated that targeting lncRNAs might be an alternative approach for treating DKD and cancer with dysregulated glucose metabolism. ",

        "AbstractText": "The diagnostic performance and prognostic value of serum exosomal glypican 1 (GPC-1) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain controversial. In this study, we detected serum exosomal GPC-1 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and determined whether it serves as a predictor of diagnosis and recurrence for early-stage PDAC. Serum samples were obtained from patients with 50 PDAC, 6 benign pancreatic tumor (BPT), or 9 chronic pancreatitis (CP) and 50 healthy controls (HCs). Serum exosomes were isolated using an exosome isolation kit. Exosomal and serum GPC-1 levels were measured using ELISA. The freeze-thaw process was carried out to analyze the stability of GPC-1. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was employed to assess the diagnostic value of GPC-1. Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox analyses were used to evaluate the prognostic value of GPC-1. The average concentrations of serum exosomal and serum GPC-1 were 1.5 and 0.8 ng/ml, respectively. GPC-1 expression levels were stable under repeated freezing and thawing (d1-5 freeze-thaw cycles vs. d0 P > 0.05). Serum exosomal and serum GPC-1 were significantly elevated in patients with PDAC compared with HCs (P < 0.0001) but were slightly higher compared with that in patients with CP and BPT (P > 0.05). The expression levels of exosomal and serum GPC-1 were elevated 5 days after surgery in patients with PDAC, CP, and BPT (P < 0.05). Patients with high levels of exosomal and serum GPC-1 had a shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) (P = 0.006, and P = 0.010). Multivariate analyses showed that serum exosomal and serum GPC-1 were independent prognostic indicators for early RFS (P = 0.008, and P = 0.041). ELISA is an effective and sensitive method to detect exosomal and serum GPC-1. The detection of GPC-1 was stable under repeated freezing and thawing cycles and could distinguish early-stage PDAC from HCs but not CP and BPT. Exosomal and serum GPC-1 may be good independent predictors of early recurrence in early-stage PDAC. ",

        "AbstractText": "In situ multiplexing analysis and in situ transcriptomics are now providing revolutionary tools to achieve the comprehension of the molecular basis of cancer and to progress towards personalized medicine to fight the disease. The complexity of these tasks requires a continuous interplay among different technologies during all the phases of the experimental procedures. New tools are thus needed and their characterization in terms of performances and limits is mandatory to reach the best resolution and sensitivity. We propose here a new experimental pipeline to obtain an optimized costs-to-benefits ratio thanks to the alternate employment of automated and manual procedures during all the phases of a multiplexing experiment from sample preparation to image collection and analysis. A comparison between ultra-fast and automated immunofluorescence staining and standard staining protocols has been carried out to compare the performances in terms of antigen saturation, background, signal-to-noise ratio and total duration. We then developed specific computational tools to collect data by automated analysis-driven fluorescence microscopy. Computer assisted selection of targeted areas with variable magnification and resolution allows employing confocal microscopy for a 3D high resolution analysis. Spatial resolution and sensitivity were thus maximized in a framework where the amount of stored data and the total requested time for the procedure were optimized and reduced with respect to a standard experimental approach.

        "AbstractText": "To evaluate the prognostic impact of folate receptor (FR)-positive circulating tumor cells (FR+ CTCs) for patients with pancreatic cancer (PC). Risk stratification before surgery for PC patients remains challenging as there are no reliable prognostic markers currently. FR+ CTCs, detected by ligand-targeted polymerase chain reaction (LT-PCR), have shown excellent diagnostic value for PC in our previous study and prognostic value in a variety of cancer types. Peripheral blood samples from 44 consecutive patients diagnosed with PC were analyzed for FR+ CTCs. 25 patients underwent tumor resection and were assigned to the surgical group. 19 patients failed to undergo radical resection because of local advance or distant metastasis and were assigned to the non-surgical group. The impact of CTCs on relapse and survival were explored. For the prognostic stratification, the optimal cut-off value of CTCs analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 14.49 folate units (FU)/3 ml. High CTC levels (> 14.49 FU/3 ml) were detected in 52.0% (13/25) of the patients in the surgical group and 63.2% (12/19) in the non-surgical group. In the surgical group, median disease-free survival (DFS) for patients with high CTC levels versus low CTC levels (< 14.49 FU/3 ml) was 8.0 versus 26.0 months (P = 0.008). In multivariable analysis, CTCs were an independent risk factor for DFS (HR: 4.589, P = 0.012). Concerning the recurrence patterns, patients with high CTC levels showed a significantly frequent rate of distant and early recurrence (P = 0.017 and P = 0.011). CTC levels remained an independent predictor for both distant (OR: 8.375, P = 0.014) and early recurrence (OR: 8.412, P = 0.013) confirmed by multivariable logistic regression. However, CTCs did not predict survival in the non-surgical group (P = 0.220). FR+ CTCs in resected PC patients could predict impaired survival and recurrence patterns after surgery. Preoperative CTC levels detected by LT-PCR may help guide treatment strategies and further studies in a larger cohort are warranted. ",

        "ArticleTitle": "Factors released by low and high-LET irradiated fibroblasts modulate migration and invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells. ",
        "AbstractText": "Radiotherapy represents a major treatment option for patients with pancreatic cancer, however, its benefits remain limited also due to the ability of cancer cells to migrate to the surrounding tissues. Low-LET ionizing radiation is well known to promote tumor cell migration and invasion, nevertheless, little data provided by studies using high-LET radiation has led to ambiguous findings. What is hypothesized to be fundamental in the modulation of migration of tumor cells exposed to ionizing radiation is the influence of the microenvironment. Therefore, the properties of cells that populate the tumor stroma cannot be ignored when studying the influence of radiation on the migratory and invasive capacity of cancer cells. This is especially important in the case of pancreatic malignancies that are characterized by an abundance of stromal cells, including cancer-associated fibroblasts, which are known to orchestrate the cross-talk with tumor cells. The current study aims to investigate whether the presence of factors released by irradiated fibroblasts affects the migratory and invasive capacity of pancreatic cancer cells exposed to different doses of photons or C-ions. AsPC-1 and AG01522 cells were irradiated with the same dose of photons or C-ions at room temperature. Through Boyden chamber assay, we tested whether factors secreted by irradiated fibroblasts may influence tumor cell migration, while the invasiveness of AsPC-1 cells was assessed using matrigel precoated inserts in which medium collected from non-irradiated (0 Gy), photon and C-ion irradiated fibroblasts, was added. Data were analyzed by Student t-test using GraphPad software. The mean &#177; s.d. was determined with a significance level of p<0.05. In the presence of conditioned medium collected from 1 Gy and 2 Gy photon irradiated fibroblasts, the number of migrated tumor cells increased (P<0.0360, P<0.0001) but decreased at 4 Gy dose (P<0.002). There was a trend of reduction in migration (P<0.0460, P<0.038, P<0.0024, P<0.0002), as well as a decrease in invasiveness (P<0.0525, P<0.0035, P<0.0868, P<0.0310) after exposure to 0.5 Gy, 1 Gy, 2 Gy and 4 Gy of C-ions. The presence of irradiated fibroblasts affected the invasiveness capability of pancreatic cancer cells, probably by the reciprocal release of soluble factors whose production is differently modulated after high or low-LET radiation. Understanding the effects of irradiation on the metastatic potential of pancreatic cancer cells is of utmost importance for improving the outcome and tailoring the therapeutic approach. This challenging scenario requires a continuous and multidisciplinary approach that involves clinicians together with researcher experts in oncological and radiation treatment. In the last years, including preclinical experiences in a multidisciplinary approach has proved to be a winning strategy in clinical oncological research. ",

The present prospective single-arm cohort study enrolled 163 patients of osteosarcoma during July 2017 to July 2022. All patients received the same treatment strategy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Both DCE-MRI and IVIM-DWI were conducted for the patients before the chemotherapy, as well as after one or two chemotherapy treatment cycles. The imaging parameters of contrast agent transfer rate between blood and tissue (Ktrans ), contrast agent back-flux rate constant (Kep ), extravascular extracellular fractional volume (Ve ), as well as pure diffusion coefficient (D value), pseudo-diffusion coefficient (D* value), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and the perfusion fraction (f value) were recorded. RECIST standard [complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD)] was used as the main clinical outcome. After two treatment cycles, 112 (68.71%) cases were with CR and PR, 31 (19.02%) cases were with SD and 20 cases (12.27%) were with PD. After 1~2 treatment cycles, patients with CR/PR showed significantly markedly lower Ktrans , Kep , Ve values, while higher D, ADC and f values compared with SD or PD patients. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were positively correlated with values of Ktrans , Kep , and Ve , while negative correlation was observed between ALP and values of D, ADC and f, as well as between LDH and D and ADC after the whole treatment. D and Kep values after two treatment cycles showed the best predictive value for diagnosis of PD. The values of Ktran , Kep , ADC as well as ALP and LDH were all risk factors for PD after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. DCE-MRI and IVIM-DWI have the potential to predict clinical outcomes of osteosarcoma patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. ",

Data from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study between 1990 and 2019 in 195 countries and territories were retrieved. Data about the number of FeBGC incident cases, deaths, DALYs, age-standardized rates (ASRs), and estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were extracted. A comparative risk assessment framework was performed to estimate the risk factors attributable to breast cancer deaths and DALYs, and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were fitted for time-series analysis to predict female cancer morbidity and mortality among Chinese AYAs until 2030. In 2019, there are 61,038 incidence cases, 8,944 deaths, and 529,380 DALYs of FeBGCs among the AYAs in China, respectively. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) values were positive scores (>0) in ASIRs and negative scores (<0) in ASMR and ASDR. Furthermore, in 2030, the incidence rate of FeBGCs would grow to 30.49 per 100,000 in China, while the mortality rate would maintain a steady state. Of the deaths and DALYs, diet high in red meat was the greatest contributor to breast cancer, while a high body mass index (BMI) was the greatest contributor to cervical, ovarian, and uterine cancers. The increasing Chinese FeBGC burden is mainly observed in AYAs and non-red meat diet, and the control of body weight could reduce FeBGC burden in China. ",

Retrospective analysis of data from a prospective trial of conversion therapy conducted between April 2018 and August 2019 in patients with GC-CY1 (NCT03718624). Skeletal muscle index (SMI) was measured at the level of the third lumbar (L3) vertebra and the sarcopenia was defined using published cut-off points in all patients. We defined &#916;SMI (%)/50 days above 9.53% for men and &#916;SMI (%)/50 days above 8.81% for women as significant muscle loss (SML) and analysed the changes in skeletal muscle during conversion therapy in relation to treatment efficacy, survival and tumour response.

We assessed hepatic and extrahepatic cancer incidence using data from BC Cancer Registry. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) comparing to the general population of BC were calculated for each cancer site from 1990 to 2016. In total, 56,823 and 1,207,357 individuals tested positive and negative for HCV, respectively. Median age at cancer diagnosis among people with and without HCV infection was 59 (interquartile range (IQR): 53-65) and 63 years (IQR: 54-74), respectively. As compared to people living without HCV, a greater proportion of people living with HCV-infection were men (66.7% vs. 44.7%, P-value <0.0001), had comorbidities (25.0% vs. 16.3%, P-value <0.0001) and were socially deprived (35.9% vs. 25.0%, P-value <0.0001).

In this study, HCV infection was associated with increased incidence of several extrahepatic cancers. The elevated incidence of multiple cancers among negative HCV testers highlights the potential contributions of screening bias and increased cancer risks associated with factors driving acquisition of infection among this population compared to the general population. Early HCV diagnosis and treatment as well as public health prevention strategies are needed to reduce the risk of extrahepatic cancers among people living with HCV and potentially populations who are at higher risk of HCV infection.

        "AbstractText": "The mitotic kinesin Eg5 has emerged as a potential anti-mitotic target for the purposes of cancer chemotherapy. Whether clinical resistance to these inhibitors can arise is unclear. We exploited HCT116 cancer cell line to select resistant clones to S-trityl-L-cysteine (STLC), an extensively studied Eg5 loop-L5 binding inhibitor. The STLC resistant clones differed in their resistance to other loop-L5 binding inhibitors but remained sensitive to the ATP class of competitive Eg5 specific inhibitors. Eg5 is still necessary for bipolar spindle formation in the resistant clones since the cells were sensitive to RNAi mediated depletion of Eg5. One clone expressing Eg5(T107N), a dominant point mutation in the P-loop of the ATP binding domain of the motor, appeared to be not only resistant but also dependent on the presence of STLC. Eg5(T107N) expression was associated also with resistance to the clinical relevant loop-L5 Eg5 inhibitors, Arry-520 and ispinesib. Ectopic expression of the Eg5(T107N) mutant in the absence of STLC was associated with strong non-exchangeable binding to microtubules causing them to bundle. Biochemical assays showed that in contrast to the wild type Eg5-STLC complex, the ATP binding site of the Eg5(T107N) is accessible for nucleotide exchange only when the inhibitor is present. We predict that resistance can be overcome by inhibitors that bind to other than the Eg5 loop-L5 binding site having different chemical scaffolds, and that allostery-dependent resistance to Eg5 inhibitors may also occur in cells and may have positive implications in chemotherapy since once diagnosed may be beneficial following cessation of the chemotherapeutic regimen.

In this paper, the occurrence of irAEs in Chinese NSCLC patients was examined, and possible risk factors for the emergence of severe irAEs were discovered. Our retrospective investigation assessed the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) and prognosis of 213 patients who received immunotherapy for NSCLC. Using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models, the association between clinicopathological traits and the incidence of severe irAEs was investigated. To assess the prognostic impact of irAEs, survival data was analyzed. Among the 213 NSCLC patients, 122 (57.3%) had irAEs of any grade, and 38 (17.8%) had high-grade (grade 3-5) AEs. Baseline peripheral absolute eosinophil count (AEC) (HR 6.58, 95% CI: 1.5-28.8, P=0.012) was found to be an independent predictor of high-grade irAEs by multivariate analysis.

Pathophysiological changes in the gastric mucosa initiated by this bacterium can persist even after pharmacological eradication and are likely attributable also to changes induced in non-infected cells as a consequence of intercellular communication via extracellular vesicles (EVs). To better understand what such changes might entail, we isolated EVs from immortalized normal gastric GES-1 cells infected (EVHp+) or not with H. pylori (EVHp-) by ultracentrifugation and characterized them. Infection of GES-1 cells with H. pylori significantly increased the release of EVs and slightly decreased the EV mean size. Incubation with EVHp+ for 24&#160;h decreased the viability of GES-1 cells, but increased the levels of IL-23 in GES-1 cells, as well as the migration of GES-1 and gastric cancer AGS cells. Furthermore, incubation of GES-1 and AGS cells with EVHp+, but not with EVHp-, promoted cell invasion and trans-endothelial migration in vitro. Moreover, stimulation of endothelial EA.hy926 cells for 16&#160;h with EVHp+ promoted the formation of linked networks. Finally, analysis by mass spectrometry identified proteins uniquely present and others enriched in EVHp+ compared to EVHp-, several of which are known targets of hypoxia induced factor-1&#945; (HIF-1&#945;) that may promote the acquisition of traits important for the genesis/progression of gastric pre-neoplastic changes associated with H. pylori infection. In conclusion, the harmful effects of H. pylori infection associated with the development of gastric malignancies may spread via EVs to non-infected areas in the early and later stages of gastric carcinogenesis.

        "AbstractText": "Colon cancer undergoes a traditional pathway from colon polyps to colon cancer. It is of great significance to investigate the key molecules involved in carcinogenesis from polyps to malignancies. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are stably expressed in human body fluids such as plasma. Here, we demonstrated a differential expression pattern of plasma circRNAs in healthy individuals, colon polyp patients and colon cancer patients using circRNA Arraystar microarray. We explored that circRNA HADHA (circHADHA) was upregulated in plasma from polyp patients, whereas it was downregulated in plasma from colon cancer patients. Overexpression of circHADHA promoted autophagy in colon epithelial cells. Moreover, in colon cancer cells, overexpression of circHADHA promoted autophagy, whereas it inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation. CircHADHA increased the expression of ATG13 via miR-361 in both colon epithelial and cancer cells. ATG13 knockdown reduced autophagy even in the presence of circHADHA in colon cancer cells. Furthermore, the growth of circHADHA-overexpressing colon cancer cell-derived xenograft tumors was significantly decreased compared with control tumors in nude mice. In conclusion, circHADHA was differentially expressed in the plasma of healthy individuals, colon polyp patients and colon cancer patients. CircHADHA promoted autophagy by regulating ATG13 via miR-361 in both colon epithelial and cancer cells. CircHADHA suppressed tumor growth by inducing cell autophagy in colon cancer cells. CircHADHA potentially serves as a biomarker for screening of precursor colon cancer and a therapeutic target for colon cancer treatment. ",

        "AbstractText": "Estimating the growth of pulmonary sub-solid nodules (SSNs) is crucial to the successful management of them during follow-up periods. The purpose of this study is to (1) investigate the measurement sensitivity of diameter, volume, and mass of SSNs for identifying growth and (2) seek to establish a deep learning-based model to predict the growth of SSNs. A total of 2,523 patients underwent at least 2-year examination records retrospectively collected with sub-solid nodules. A total of 2,358 patients with 3,120 SSNs from the NLST dataset were randomly divided into training and validation sets. Patients from the Yibicom Health Management Center and Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital were collected as an external test set (165 patients with 213 SSN). Trained models based on LUNA16 and Lndb19 datasets were employed to automatically obtain the diameter, volume, and mass of SSNs. Then, the increase rate in measurements between cancer and non-cancer groups was studied to evaluate the most appropriate way to identify growth-associated lung cancer. Further, according to the selected measurement, all SSNs were classified into two groups: growth and non-growth. Based on the data, the deep learning-based model (SiamModel) and radiomics model were developed and verified. The double time of diameter, volume, and mass were 711 vs. 963 days (P = 0.20), 552 vs. 621 days (P = 0.04) and 488 vs. 623 days (P< 0.001) in the cancer and non-cancer groups, respectively. Our proposed SiamModel performed better than the radiomics model in both the NLST validation set and external test set, with an AUC of 0.858 (95% CI 0.786-0.921) and 0.760 (95% CI 0.646-0.857) in the validation set and 0.862 (95% CI 0.789-0.927) and 0.681 (95% CI 0.506-0.841) in the external test set, respectively. Furthermore, our SiamModel could use the data from first-time CT to predict the growth of SSNs, with an AUC of 0.855 (95% CI 0.793-0.908) in the NLST validation set and 0.821 (95% CI 0.725-0.904) in the external test set. Mass increase rate can reflect more sensitively the growth of SSNs associated with lung cancer than diameter and volume increase rates. A deep learning-based model has a great potential to predict the growth of SSNs. ",

        "AbstractText": "Pediatric Early Warning Systems (PEWS) reduce clinical deterioration, improve interdisciplinary communication, and provide cost savings; however, little is known about how these impacts are achieved or related. This study evaluates the multi-level impacts of PEWS in resource-limited pediatric oncology centers. We conducted 71 semi-structured interviews including physicians (45%), nurses (45%), and administrators (10%) from 5 resource-limited pediatric oncology centers in 4 Latin American countries. Interviews were conducted in Spanish, transcribed, and translated into English. A code book was developed using a priori and inductively derived codes. Transcripts were independently coded by 2 coders, achieving a kappa of 0.8-0.9. Thematic content analysis explored perceived impacts of PEWS at the level of the patient, clinician, healthcare team, and institution. PEWS improved the quality of attention for patients, reducing morbidity and mortality. Clinicians felt more knowledgeable, confident, and empowered providing patient care, resulting in greater job satisfaction. PEWS affected team dynamics by improving interdisciplinary (ward and intensive care unit) and interprofessional (physicians and nurses) relationships and communication. This ultimately led to institutional culture change with emphasis on patient safety, collaboration with other centers, and receipt of institutional awards. Together, these impacts led to hospital-wide support of ongoing PEWS use. In resource-limited hospitals, PEWS use results in multi-level positive impacts on patients, clinicians, teams, and institutions, creating a feedback loop that further supports ongoing PEWS use. These findings can guide advocacy for PEWS to various stakeholders, improve PEWS effectiveness, and inform assessment of other interventions to improve childhood cancer outcomes. ",

        "AbstractText": "Osimertinib is a standard therapy for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) mutations, but most patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC develop secondary resistance to osimertinib. Mesenchymal-epithelial transition gene (MET) alterations and oncogene fusions have been identified as the most common mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib. However, MET exon 14 skipping mutation (METex14del) as an acquired resistance to osimertinib has rarely been reported. A non-smoking 76-year-old woman was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma in the right lower lobe (cT2bN2M1c [pulmonary and bone metastases], cStage IVB). The primary tumor was submitted to cobas&#174; EGFR Mutation Test v2 (Roche Diagnostics Ltd.), next generation sequencing (Oncomine Comprehensive Assay v3; Thermo Fisher Scientific), the AmoyDx&#174; Essential NGS panel (Amoy Diagnostics, Xiamen, China), all of which were positive for EGFR L858R and de novo T790M. We administered daily osimertinib (80 mg/day), and achieved a partial response. However, after 14.0 months, computed tomography showed progression of the primary tumor and lung metastases. Re-biopsy of the primary tumor was conducted, and the specimen was submitted to Archer&#174;MET companion diagnostic for detection of METex14del. Although the primary tumor was negative for METex14del, the re-biopsy specimen was positive for METex14del. We validated that the biopsy specimen of the primary tumor at diagnosis before osimertinib administration was negative for METex14del using local reverse transcription PCR. We administered daily tepotinib (500 mg/day) to the patient as a further-line treatment, and achieved a partial response (tumor shrinkage rate: 34.5%) after 2.0 months, who responded to tepotinib therapy for 8.0 months. We described a patient with lung adenocarcinoma harboring METex14del as a potential acquired resistance to osimertinib, who responded to subsequent tepotinib therapy. Re-biopsy and re-analysis of genetic profiles should be considered in NSCLC patients who develop osimertinib resistance. ",

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD1, anti-PDL1, and anti-CTLA4) are effective in 20% of UPS patients. We characterize the immune microenvironment of UPS and its association with oncologic outcomes. Surgically resected UPS samples were stained by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the following: tumor-associated immune cells (CD3, CD8, CD163, CD20), immune checkpoints (stimulatory: OX40, ICOS; inhibitory: PD-L1, LAG3, IDO1, PD1), and the adenosine pathway (CD73, CD39). Sections were reviewed for the presence of lymphoid aggregates (LA). Clinical data were retrospectively obtained for all samples. The Wilcoxon rank-sum and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare distributions. Correlations between biomarkers were measured by Spearman correlation. Univariate and multivariate Cox models were used to identify biomarkers associated with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Unsupervised clustering was performed, and Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests used for comparison of OS and DFS between immune clusters. Samples analyzed (n=105) included 46 primary tumors, 34 local recurrences, and 25 metastases. LA were found in 23% (n=10/43), 17% (n=4/24), and 30% (n=7/23) of primary, recurrent, and metastatic samples, respectively. In primary UPS, CD73 expression was significantly higher after preoperative radiation therapy (p=0.009). CD39 expression was significantly correlated with PD1 expression (primary: p=0.002, recurrent: p=0.004, metastatic: p=0.001), PD-L1 expression (primary: p=0.009), and CD3+ cell densities (primary: p=0.016, recurrent: p=0.043, metastatic: p=0.028).

        "AbstractText": "Early activation of palliative care for patients with advanced cancer is central in the treatment trajectory. At the Veneto Institute of Oncology, a simultaneous-care outpatient clinic (SCOC) has been active since 2014, where patients are evaluated by an oncologist together with a palliative care team. Recently, we reported on consecutive patients admitted at SCOC from 2018 to 2021 in terms of appropriateness, process, and outcome indicators. Here, we report further analysis in the same group of 753 patients, evaluating other parameters and the correlation between symptom intensity, gender, age, and survival. SCOC data were retrieved from a prospectively maintained database. Among the patients, 42.2% were women, and the median age was 68 years, with 46.7% of patients aged &#8805;70 years. The most prevalent disease type was gastrointestinal cancer (75.2%), and 90.9% of the patients had metastatic disease. The median score for the distress thermometer was 4; the vast majority of the patients (98.6%) reported physical problems, and 69.4% presented emotional issues. Younger women demonstrated a significantly greater median distress than other patients (p=0.0018). Almost all symptoms had a higher prevalence on the 0-3 Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) score, except for fatigue. About 43.8% of the patients received systemic anticancer treatment (SAT) in the last 60 days of life, 15.0% of whom received SAT in the last month and 3.1% in the last 2 weeks. For some symptoms, women frequently had more ESAS >3. Pain and nausea were significantly less reported by older patients compared with younger adults. Men had a lower risk of having MUST score &#8805; 2 (p=0.0311). Men and older patients showed a lower prognosis awareness (p=0.0011 and p=0.0049, respectively). Older patients received less SAT within the last 30 days of life (p=0.0006) and had death risk decreased by 20.0%. Our study identified two subgroups of patients with advanced cancer who require special attention and support due to important symptoms' burden detected by Patient Reported Outcome Measures tests: women and younger adults. These categories of patients require special attention and should be provided early access at SCOC. The role of an oncologist remains crucial to intercept all patients in need of early palliative care and balancing trade-offs of anticancer treatment in advanced metastatic disease. ",

The cohort studies reporting on the relationship between CTC and prognosis of gastric cancer were collected from Pubmed, Cochrane, Embase, CNKI, WanFang Data, and VIP databases. The two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted the data, and evaluated the bias risk of the included literature. The data were analyzed by Revman software (Review Manager version 5.4). A total of 14 retrospective cohort studies with 1053 patients were included. The results showed that the overall survival time (OS) and progression-free survival time (PFS) of CTC-positive patients were shorter compared to CTC-negative patients. Taking into consideration the critical value of CTC positive patients, country of origin, sample size, treatment mode, and study time, the subgroup analysis showed that CTC-positive was related to the shortening of OS in patients with gastric cancer. Based on the subgroup analysis of the factors such as CTC positive critical value < 2.8, sample size &#8805; 75, mixed therapy, longer study duration, country, and immunofluorescence detection of CTC, it was found that OS in CTC positive group was shorter than that in CTC-negative group (all P<0.05), while the critical value of positive CTC &#8805; 2.8, sample size &#8805; 75, choice of treatment only for operation or non-operation, short study time and molecular detection of CTC were not associated with OS (all P>0.05). In addition, CTC-positive patients had a more advanced TNM staging, poorer tumor differentiation, and earlier distant metastasis. CTC can be used as a prognostic indicator of gastric cancer. Gastric cancer patients with positive CTC may have a poorer prognosis compared to those with CTC-negative tumors. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, identifier CRD42022323155. ",

        "AbstractText": "Radiation therapy (RT) is an important modality in cancer treatment with >50% of cancer patients undergoing RT for curative or palliative intent. In patients with breast, lung, and esophageal cancer, as well as mediastinal malignancies, incidental RT dose to heart or vascular structures has been linked to the development of Radiation-Induced Heart Disease (RIHD) which manifests as ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysfunction, and heart failure. Despite the remarkable progress in the delivery of radiotherapy treatment, off-target cardiac toxicities are unavoidable. One of the best-studied pathological consequences of incidental exposure of the heart to RT is collagen deposition and fibrosis, leading to the development of radiation-induced myocardial fibrosis (RIMF). However, the pathogenesis of RIMF is still largely unknown. Moreover, there are no available clinical approaches to reverse RIMF once it occurs and it continues to impair the quality of life of long-term cancer survivors. Hence, there is an increasing need for more clinically relevant preclinical models to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the development of RIMF. This review offers an insight into the existing preclinical models to study RIHD and the suggested mechanisms of RIMF, as well as available multi-modality treatments and outcomes. Moreover, we summarize the valuable detection methods of RIHD/RIMF, and the clinical use of sensitive radiographic and circulating biomarkers. ",

However, evidence is still limited on using routinely PROs to personalize treatment decision-making, including or not chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and radiotherapy. Using patient baseline PRO scores, we aimed to use PROs before treatment initiation to predict improvement or decline in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) due to treatment that they receive. In two French cancer sites, women with non-metastatic BC completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 and BREAST-Q questionnaires to assess their PROs at baseline and again at 6 months. The outcome measured was post-operative change in PROs with minimal important difference for QLQ-C30 domains. We performed multivariate ordinal logistic regression to estimate the incremental probability of post-operative PRO improvements and deteriorations depending upon treatment options and baseline HRQoL. One hundred twenty-seven women completed questionnaires. Chemotherapy had significant negative impacts on Global health status (GHS) and on physical and social functioning. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy increased patient fatigue scores after adjusting for clinical factors (p< 0.01 and p< 0.05, respectively). The incremental probability of GHS deteriorations for chemotherapy was +0.3, +0.5, and +0.34 for patients with baseline GHS scores of 40, 70, and 100, respectively. This showed that different pre-treatment PROs might predict differential effects of chemotherapy on women change in HRQoL. Patients with different baseline PRO scores may experience dissimilar impacts from BC treatments on post-operative PROs in terms of improvements and deteriorations. Oncologists might decide to adapt the treatment option based on a given level of the negative impact. Future studies should concentrate on incorporating this information into routine clinical decision-making strategies to optimize the treatment benefit for patients. ",

        "AbstractText": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a fundamental role in the development of cancers and their response to therapy. In recent years, CAFs have returned to the spotlight as researchers work to unpick the mechanisms by which they impact tumour evolution and therapy responses. However, study of CAFs has largely been restricted to a select number of common cancers, whereas research into CAF biology in bladder cancer has been relatively neglected. In this review, we explore the basics of CAF biology including the numerous potential cellular origins of CAFs, alongside mechanisms of CAF activation and their diverse functionality. We find CAFs play an important role in the progression of bladder cancer with significant implications on tumour cell signaling, epithelial to mesenchymal transition and the capacity to modify components of the immune system. In addition, we highlight some of the landmark papers describing CAF heterogeneity and find trends in the literature to suggest that the iCAF and myCAF subtypes defined in bladder cancer share common characteristics with CAF subtypes described in other settings such as breast and pancreatic cancer. Moreover, based on findings in other common cancers we identify key therapeutic challenges associated with CAFs, such as the lack of specific CAF markers, the paucity of research into bladder-specific CAFs and their relationship with therapies such as radiotherapy. Of relevance, we describe a variety of strategies used to target CAFs in several common cancers, paying particular attention to TGF&#946; signaling as a prominent regulator of CAF activation. In doing so, we find parallels with bladder cancer that suggest CAF targeting may advance therapeutic options in this setting and improve the current poor survival outcomes in bladder cancer which sadly remain largely unchanged over recent decades.

        "AbstractText": "Proteases are known to promote or impair breast cancer progression and metastasis. However, while a small number of the 588 human and 672 murine protease genes have been extensively studied, others were neglected. For an unbiased functional analysis of all genome-encoded proteases, i.e., the degradome, in breast cancer cell growth, we applied an inducible RNA interference library for protease-focused genetic screens. Importantly, these functional screens were performed in two phenotypically different murine breast cancer cell lines, including one stem cell-like cell line that showed phenotypic plasticity under changed nutrient and oxygen availability. Our unbiased genetic screens identified 252 protease genes involved in breast cancer cell growth that were further restricted to 100 hits by a selection process. Many of those hits were supported by literature, but some proteases were novel in their functional link to breast cancer. Interestingly, we discovered that the environmental conditions influence the degree of breast cancer cell dependency on certain proteases. For example, breast cancer stem cell-like cells were less susceptible to depletion of several mitochondrial proteases in hypoxic conditions. From the 100 hits, nine proteases were functionally validated in murine breast cancer cell lines using individual knockdown constructs, highlighting the high reliability of our screens. Specifically, we focused on mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) subunits alpha (Pmpca) and beta (Pmpcb) and discovered that MPP depletion led to a disadvantage in cell growth, which was linked to mitochondrial dysfunction.

To explore cardiovascular disease (CVD)-specific mortality and prognostic factors among patients with penile squamous cell carcinomas (PSCC). These results aid clinicians in furtherly understand this disease's prognosis. We analyzed Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program data for 2668 PSCC cases diagnosed between 2005 to 2016. We calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) of CVD and all-cause mortality, comparing PSCC patients with general population men. A cumulative mortality curve and competitive risk regression model were utilized to evaluate the prognostic factors of CVD-specific death. Death distribution is as follows: PSCC (42.4%), other causes (21.3%) CVD (19%), and other cancers (17.3%). PSCC patients are more like to die from CVD (SMR=3.2, 95%CI: 3.1-3.3) and all-cause death compared with the general population. Meanwhile, patients undergoing surgery show a relatively higher CVD-specific mortality than the general population (SMR=2.7, 95%CI: 2.4-3.2). In the competitive risk model, higher CVD mortality is associated with age, region, year of diagnosis, stage, and marital status (all P<0.05). Patients with the localized stage show a higher risk of CVD-specific death than those with regional or distant stage. Our study mainly reveals that cardiovascular disease was the important cause of death and higher CVD-specific mortality among PSCC patients. Several associated factors related to CVD-specific death are also identified.

In conclusion, A novel methylation marker LBX2 could be used as a simple, cost-effective, and reliable diagnostic method for LNM of CRC. ",

        "AbstractText": "This study was aimed to profile hotspot exonuclease domain mutations (EDMs) of the DNA polymerase &#1013; gene (POLE) in endometrial cancer (EC) and to investigate the effects of EDMs on tumor cell behavior and catalytic activities of Pol&#1013;. POLE sequencing was performed in tumor tissue samples from patients with EC to identify hotspot EDMs. Bioinformatics tools were used to select the potential pathogenic EDMs. The association of EDMs with the clinical outcomes of patients was assessed. EC cells were transfected with wildtype POLE or POLE variants to examine the effects of the EDMs on EC cell behavior, including cell cycle, migration, and invasion. Co-immunoprecipitation was employed to obtain FLAG-tagged wildtype and mutant catalytic subunits of Pol&#1013;, followed by the assessment of polymerase and exonuclease activities. In addition to previously reported P286R and V411L, R375Q and P452L were identified as novel, and deleterious POLE hotspot EDMs of EC. Patients in EDM group had significantly better clinical outcomes than the rest of the cohort. Compared with wildtype POLE, overexpression of POLE variants promoted cisplatin resistance, G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, and cell migration and invasion in EC cells. Overexpression of POLE variants significantly increased the abundance of 3'-OH and upregulated the expression of DNA mismatch repair genes in HEK293T cells. Compared with wildtype Pol&#1013;, Pol &#1013; mutants exhibited undermined polymerase and exonuclease abilities in the presence of mismatched nucleotides in HEK293 cells. We characterized the of hotspot exonuclease domain mutations in the DNA polymerase &#1013; gene and identified P286R, V411L, R375Q, and P452L as pathogenic POLE hotspot EDMs in endometrial cancer. These hotspot EDMs are associated with the malignant behavior of endometrial cancer cells in vitro and favorable prognosis in patients, suggesting that POLE affects a wide range of cellular processes beyond DNA replication and proofreading.

        "ArticleTitle": "Identification of adenylate cyclase 2 methylation in bladder cancer with implications for prognosis and immunosuppressive microenvironment. ",
        "AbstractText": "The incidence and mortality of bladder cancer (BCa) are increasing, while the existing diagnostic methods have limitations. Therefore, for early detection and response prediction, it is crucial to improve the prognosis and treatment strategies. However, with existing diagnostic methods, detecting BCa in the early stage is challenging. Hence, novel biomarkers are urgently needed to improve early diagnosis and treatment efficiency. The gene expression profile and gene methylation profile dataset were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs), differentially methylated genes (DMGs), and methylation-regulated differentially expressed genes (MeDEGs) were gradually identified. A cancer genome map was obtained using online gene expression profile interaction analysis, and survival implications were produced using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. GSEA was employed to predict the marker pathways where DEGs were significantly involved. The study used bisulfite PCR amplification combined with bisulfite amplicon sequencing (BSAS) to screen for methylation analysis of multiple candidate regions of the adenylate cyclase 2 (ADCY2) based on the sequence design of specific gene regions and CpG islands. In this study, DEGs and DMGs with significantly up- or down-regulated expression were selected. The intersection method was used to screen the MeDEGs. The interaction network group in STRING was then visualized using Cytoscape, and the PPI network was constructed to identify the key genes. The key genes were then analyzed using functional enrichment. To compare the relationship between key genes and the prognosis of BCa patients, we further investigated ADCY2 and found that ADCY2 can be a potential clinical biomarker in BCa prognosis and immunotherapy response prediction. In human BCa 5637 and MGH1 cells, we developed and verified the effectiveness of ADCY2 primers using BSAS technology. The findings revealed that the expression of ADCY2 is highly regulated by the methylation of the promoter regions. This study revealed that increased expression of ADCY2 was significantly correlated with increased tumor heterogeneity, predicting worse survival and immunotherapy response in BCa patients. ",

        "AbstractText": "Renal cancer is one of the most lethal cancers because of its atypical symptoms and metastatic potential. The metabolism of amino acids and their derivatives is essential for cancer cell survival and proliferation. Thus, the construction of the amino acid metabolism-related risk signature might enhance the accuracy of the prognostic model and shed light on the treatments of renal cancers. RNA expression and clinical data were downloaded from Santa Cruz (UCSC) Xena, GEO, and ArrayExpress databases. The \"DESeq2\" package identified the differentially expressed genes. Univariate COX analysis selected prognostic genes related to the metabolism of amino acids. Patients were divided into two clusters using the \"ConsensusClusterPlus\" package, and the CIBERSORT, ESTIMATE methods were explored to assess the immune infiltrations. The LASSO regression analysis constructed a risk model which was evaluated the prediction accuracy in two independent cohorts. The genomic alterations and drug sensitivity of 18-LASSO-genes were assessed. The differentially expressed genes between two clusters were used to perform functional enrichment analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Furthermore, external validation of TMEM72 expression was conducted in the FUSCC cohort containing 33 ccRCC patients. The amino acid metabolism-related genes had significant correlations with prognosis. The patients in Cluster A demonstrated better survival, lower Treg cell proportion, higher ESTIMATE scores, and higher cuproptosis-related gene expressions. Amino acid metabolism-related genes with prognostic values were used to construct a risk model and patients in the low risk group were associated with improved outcomes. The Area Under Curve of the risk model was 0.801, 0.777, and 0.767 at the first, second, and third year respectively. The external validation cohort confirmed the stable prognostic value of the risk model. WGCNA identified four gene modules correlated with immune cell infiltrations and cuproptosis. We found that TMEM72 was downregulated in tumors by using TCGA, GEO datasets (p<0.001) and the FUSCC cohort (p=0.002). Our study firstly constructed an 18 amino acid metabolism related signature to predict the prognosis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma. We also identified four potential gene modules potentially correlated with cuproptosis and identified TMEM72 downregulation in ccRCC which deserved further studies. ",

However, the inflammatory landscape in soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and its clinical consequences are yet unknown, and more investigation is needed. RNA-seq expression data for STS and corresponding normal tissues were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and the Genotype-Tissue Expression Portal. Differential and prognostic analyses were performed based on known inflammatory response genes from Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). We utilized LASSO-Cox analysis to determine hub genes and built an inflammatory score (INFscore) and risk stratification model. Furthermore, a nomogram, including the risk stratification model, was established to predict the prognosis. We further elucidated the characteristics among different risk STS patients by GSEA, gene set variation analysis, and detailed immune infiltration analysis. Finally, the INFscore and risk stratification model in predicting prognosis and depicting immune microenvironment status were verified by pan-cancer analysis. Five hub genes (HAS2, IL1R1, NMI, SERPINE1, and TACR1) were identified and were used to develop the INFscore. The risk stratification model distinguished the immune microenvironment status and evaluated the efficacy of immunotherapy and chemotherapy in STS. The novel nomogram had good efficacy in predicting the prognosis of STS patients. Finally, a pan-cancer investigation verified the association of INFscore with prognosis and immunity. According to the present study, the risk stratification model can be used to evaluate STS prognosis, tumor microenvironment status, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy efficacy. The novel nomogram has an excellent predictive value. Thus, the INFscore and risk stratification model has potential value in assessing the prognosis and immune status of multiple malignancies. ",

        "AbstractText": "Tumor necrosis is a poor prognostic marker in glioblastoma (GBM) and a variety of other solid cancers. Accumulating evidence supports that necrosis could facilitate tumor progression and resistance to therapeutics. GBM necrosis is typically first detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), after prominent necrosis has already formed. Therefore, radiological appearances of early necrosis formation and the temporal-spatial development of necrosis alongside tumor progression remain poorly understood. This knowledge gap leads to a lack of reliable radiographic diagnostic/prognostic markers in early GBM progression to detect necrosis. Recently, we reported an orthotopic xenograft GBM murine model driven by hyperactivation of the Hippo pathway transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) which recapitulates the extent of GBM necrosis seen among patients. In this study, we utilized this model to perform a temporal radiographic and histological study of necrosis development. We observed tumor tissue actively undergoing necrosis first appears more brightly enhancing in the early stages of progression in comparison to the rest of the tumor tissue. Later stages of tumor progression lead to loss of enhancement and unenhancing signals in the necrotic central portion of tumors on T1-weighted post-contrast MRI. This central unenhancing portion coincides with the radiographic and clinical definition of necrosis among GBM patients. Moreover, as necrosis evolves, two relatively more contrast-enhancing rims are observed in relationship to the solid enhancing tumor surrounding the central necrosis in the later stages. The outer more prominently enhancing rim at the tumor border probably represents the infiltrating tumor edge, and the inner enhancing rim at the peri-necrotic region may represent locally infiltrating immune cells. The associated inflammation at the peri-necrotic region was further confirmed by immunohistochemical study of the temporal development of tumor necrosis. Neutrophils appear to be the predominant immune cell population in this region as necrosis evolves. This study shows central, brightly enhancing areas associated with inflammation in the tumor microenvironment may represent an early indication of necrosis development in GBM. ",

Suffering at the end of life (EOL) is often undertreated and underrecognized. Pain and poor quality of life are common concerns amongst parents and providers at a child's EOL. Integration of palliative care (PC) may decrease suffering and improve symptom management in many clinical situations; however, few studies have described medical management and symptom burden in children with cancer in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) undergoing de-escalation of LSTs. A retrospective chart review was completed for deceased pediatric oncology patients who experienced compassionate extubation and/or withdrawal of vasopressor support at EOL in the PICU. Demographics, EOL characteristics, and medication use for symptom management were abstracted. Descriptive analyses were applied. Charts of 43 patients treated over a 10-year period were reviewed. Most patients (69.8%) were white males who had undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and experienced compassionate extubation (67.4%) and/or withdrawal of vasopressor support (44.2%). The majority (88.3%) had a physician order for scope of treatment (POST - DNaR) in place an average of 13.9 days before death. PC was consulted for all but one patient; however, in 18.6% of cases, consultations occurred on the day of death. During EOL, many patients received medications to treat or prevent respiratory distress, pain, and agitation/anxiety. Sedative medications were utilized, specifically propofol (14%), dexmedetomidine (12%), or both (44%), often with opioids and benzodiazepines. Pediatric oncology patients undergoing de-escalation of LSTs experience symptoms of pain, anxiety, and respiratory distress during EOL. Dexmedetomidine and propofol may help prevent and/or relieve suffering during compassionate de-escalation of LSTs.

        "AbstractText": "Recent studies have reported that IGF2BP3 is linked to the pathogenesis of various malignancies. Since IGF2BP3 is associated with poor outcomes of gallbladder carcinoma (GBC), we aimed to explore the association between its N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation and GBC progression. Bioinformatic analysis of GSE136982, GSE104165, and RNA-seq was performed. In vitro and in vivo gain- and loss-of-function assays were done. qPCR, Western blotting, and IHC were conducted in cells or in collected clinical tissue samples. RNA immunoprecipitation, RNA stability measurement, methylated RNA immunoprecipitation, and dual-luciferase reporter assays were performed in this study. The expression of IGF2BP3 was higher in GBC tissues than in peritumoral tissues. Functions such as cell proliferation and migration, both in vitro and in vivo, were inhibited by downregulation of IGF2BP3. The analysis of RNA-seq indicated that KLK5 was a downstream target of IGF2BP3. The expression of KLK5 was measured in GBC cells and tumor samples. It was found to be positively correlated with IGF2BP3 level. Upon IGF2BP3 depletion, ectopic expression of KLK5 could rescue cell function in part. Mechanistically, we found that IGF2BP3 directly binds to KLK5 mRNA and regulates its stability in an m6A-dependent manner. As a result, inhibition of KLK5 decreased the expression of PAR2, and deregulated phospho-Akt. Using bioinformatic prediction combined with miRNA microarray analysis, we identified that let-7g-5p is an inhibitor of IGF2BP3, and let-7g-5p expression was negatively correlated with IGF2BP3. Overexpression of let-7g-5p affected the aggressive phenotype of GBC cells by deregulating IGF2BP3, and inhibiting the KLK5/PAR2/AKT axis. Our data showed that IGF2BP3 is associated with the aggressive phenotype of GBC. Mechanistically, IGF2BP3 activated the PAR2/AKT axis by stabilizing KLK5 mRNA in an m6A-dependent manner. The loss of let-7g-5p enhanced the expression of IGF2BP3 and improved GBC progression. Thus, IGF2BP3 plays a crucial role in GBC, and the let-7g-5p/IGF2BP3/KLK5/PAR2 axis may be a therapeutic target for GBC. ",

Most of HCC patients are diagnosed as Hepatitis B related cirrhosis simultaneously, especially in Asian countries. HCC is the fifth most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related death in the World. HCC incidence rates have been rising in the past 3 decades, and it is expected to be doubled by 2030, if there is no effective means for its early diagnosis and management. The improvement of patient's care, research, and policy is significantly based on accurate medical diagnosis, especially for malignant tumor patients. However, sometimes it is really difficult to get access to advanced and expensive diagnostic tools such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET-CT)., especially for people who resides in poverty-stricken area. Therefore, experts are searching for a framework for predicting of early liver diseases based on basic and simple examinations such as biochemical and routine blood tests, which are easily accessible all around the World. Disease identification and classification has been significantly enhanced by using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in conjunction with clinical data. The goal of this research is to extract the most significant risk factors or clinical parameters for liver diseases in 525 patients based on clinical experience using machine learning algorithms, such as regularized regression (RR), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The results showed that RF classier had the best performance (accuracy = 0.762, recall = 0.843, F1-score = 0.775, and AUC = 0.999) among the five ML algorithms. And the important orders of 14 significant risk factors are as follows: Total bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), direct bilirubin, hemoglobin, age, platelet, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate transaminase (AST), creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), cholesterol, albumin, urea nitrogen, and white blood cells. ML classifiers might aid medical organizations in the early detection and classification of liver disease, which would be beneficial in low-income regions, and the relevance of risk factors would be helpful in the prevention and treatment of liver disease patients.

This study evaluated the radiomic model's robustness and generalizability after screening out low-robust features before radiomic modeling. The results were validated with four datasets and two clinically relevant tasks. A total of 1,419 head-and-neck cancer patients' computed tomography images, gross tumor volume segmentation, and clinically relevant outcomes (distant metastasis and local-regional recurrence) were collected from four publicly available datasets. The perturbation method was implemented to simulate images, and the radiomic feature robustness was quantified using intra-class correlation of coefficient (ICC). Three radiomic models were built using all features (ICC > 0), good-robust features (ICC > 0.75), and excellent-robust features (ICC > 0.95), respectively. A filter-based feature selection and Ridge classification method were used to construct the radiomic models. Model performance was assessed with both robustness and generalizability. The robustness of the model was evaluated by the ICC, and the generalizability of the model was quantified by the train-test difference of Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC). The average model robustness ICC improved significantly from 0.65 to 0.78 (P< 0.0001) using good-robust features and to 0.91 (P< 0.0001) using excellent-robust features. Model generalizability also showed a substantial increase, as a closer gap between training and testing AUC was observed where the mean train-test AUC difference was reduced from 0.21 to 0.18 (P< 0.001) in good-robust features and to 0.12 (P< 0.0001) in excellent-robust features. Furthermore, good-robust features yielded the best average AUC in the unseen datasets of 0.58 (P< 0.001) over four datasets and clinical outcomes. Including robust only features in radiomic modeling significantly improves model robustness and generalizability in unseen datasets. Yet, the robustness of radiomic model has to be verified despite building with robust radiomic features, and tightly restricted feature robustness may prevent the optimal model performance in the unseen dataset as it may lower the discrimination power of the model.

Due to the involvement of many regulatory molecules and signaling pathways, the occurrence and development of metastases needs to be further studied. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ubiquitously expressed small non-coding RNAs that have been shown to play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases, as well as representing an attractive candidate for metastasis control. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of potassium piperonate (GBK) in impairing breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis by targeting miR-31. Breast cancer cells, either treated with GBK or left untreated, were assessed for migration and invasion capacities using wound healing and transwell assays. GBK-targeted miRNAs were identified and verified using RT-qPCR. Western blotting was used to validate the changes in expression levels of miR-31-targeted genes. Methylation specific PCR was performed to detect the effect of GBK on the methylation levels of the lncRNA LOC554202 host gene. The synergistic effect of GBK and the chemotherapy drug cisplatin (DDP) on breast cancer cells was verified using cell proliferation, colony formation, and RT-qPCR assays in vitro, and the tumor xenograft model in vivo. We found that miR-31 was the main target of GBK. GBK treatment affected the epigenetic modification at CpG sites by downregulating DNA methyltransferases. Thus, the CpG-associated methylation levels of lncRNA LOC554202 decreased significantly, and in turn upregulated both miR-31 and its host gene LOC554202 in breast cancer cells. We also observed the significant inhibition of miR-31-targeted genes following GBK treatment, including RHOA, WAVE3, and SATB2, with functions closely related to cancer cell invasion, migration, and proliferation. Furthermore, we revealed that the combination of GBK and DDP had a synergistic effect on inhibiting the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, especially in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). This study investigated the target of GBK in the inhibition of breast cancer migration and invasion, and the underlying mechanisms involved, providing theoretical support for the development of GBK as an auxiliary drug for clinical treatment.

In contrast, here we show that elevated expression of Aurora B reduces phosphorylation of six different Aurora B substrates across three species and causes defects consistent with Aurora B inhibition. Complexes of Aurora B and its binding partner INCENP autophosphorylate in trans to achieve full Aurora B activation. Increased expression of Aurora B mislocalizes INCENP, reducing the local concentration of Aurora B:INCENP complexes at the inner centromere/kinetochore. Co-expression of INCENP rescues Aurora B kinase activity and mitotic defects caused by elevated Aurora B. However, INCENP expression is not elevated in concert with Aurora B in breast cancer, and increased expression of Aurora B causes resistance rather than hypersensitivity to Aurora B inhibitors. Thus, increased Aurora B expression reduces, rather than increases, Aurora B kinase activity. ",

        "AbstractText": "Downregulated expression of anti-tumor miR-383 has been found in many kinds of cancer. MiR-383 family members can directly target the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the mRNA of some pro-tumor genes to attenuate several cancer-related processes, including cell proliferation, invasion, migration, angiogenesis, immunosuppression, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, glycolysis, chemoresistance, and the development of cancer stem cells, whilst promoting apoptosis. Functionally, miR-383 operates as a tumor inhibitor miRNA in many types of cancer, including breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, glioma, medulloblastoma, melanoma, prostate cancer, cervical cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma, thyroid cancer, and B-cell lymphoma. Both pro-tumor and anti-tumor effects have been attributed to miR-383 in ovarian cancer. However, only the pro-tumor effects of miR-383 were reported in cholangiocarcinoma. The restoration of miR-383 expression could be considered a possible treatment for cancer. This review discusses the anti-tumor effects of miR-383 in human cancers, emphasizing their downstream target genes and potential treatment approaches. ",

        "AbstractText": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most common hematopoietic malignancies in adults. The tumor microenvironment (TME) has a critical effect on AML occurrence, recurrence, and progression. The gene feline leukemia virus subgroup C cellular receptor family member 2 (FLVCR2) belongs to the major facilitator superfamily of transporter protein members, which is primarily involved in transporting small molecules. The potential role of FLVCR2 in the TME in AML has not been investigated. To clarify the expression and role of FLVCR2 in AML, we analyzed the Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas databases and found that FLVCR2 mRNA expression significantly increased among patients with AML. Furthermore, based on an analysis of the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis database, FLVCR2 upregulation predicted dismal overall survival of patients with AML. Our validation analysis revealed the significant upregulation of FLVCR2 within the bone marrow of AML relative to healthy controls by western blotting and qPCR assays. Gene set enrichment analysis was conducted to explore FLVCR2's related mechanism in AML. We found that high FLVCR2 expression was related to infiltration degrees of immune cells and immune scores among AML cases, indicating that FLVCR2 possibly had a crucial effect on AML progression through the immune response. Specifically, FLVCR2 upregulation was negatively related to the immune infiltration degrees of activated natural killer cells, activated memory CD4+ T cells, activated dendritic cells, and CD8+ T cells using CIBERSORT analysis. According to the in vitro research, FLVCR2 silencing suppressed AML cell growth and promoted their apoptosis. This study provides insights into FLVCR2's effect on tumor immunity, indicating that it might serve as an independent prognostic biomarker and was related to immune infiltration within AML. ",

        "AbstractText": "A transgenic mouse approach using bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) was used to identify regulatory regions that direct M&#252;llerian duct expression for Amhr2 and Osterix (Osx, also known as Sp7). Amhr2 encodes the receptor that mediates anti-M&#252;llerian hormone (AMH) signaling for M&#252;llerian duct regression in male embryos. Amhr2 is expressed in the M&#252;llerian duct mesenchyme of both male and female embryos. A &#8764;147-kb BAC clone containing the Amhr2 locus was used to generate transgenic mice. The transgene was able to rescue the block in M&#252;llerian duct regression of Amhr2-null males, suggesting that the BAC clone contains regulatory sequences active in male embryos. Osx is expressed in the developing skeleton of male and female embryos but is also an AMH-induced gene that is expressed in the M&#252;llerian duct mesenchyme exclusively in male embryos. Osx-Cre transgenic mice were previously generated using a &#8764;204-kb BAC clone. Crosses of Osx-Cre mice to Cre-dependent lacZ reporter mice resulted in reporter expression in the developing skeleton and in the M&#252;llerian duct mesenchyme of male but not female embryos. Osx-Cherry transgenic mice were previously generated using a 39-kb genomic region surrounding the Osx locus. Osx-Cherry embryos expressed red fluorescence in the developing skeleton and M&#252;llerian duct mesenchyme of male but not female embryos. In addition, female Osx-Cherry embryos ectopically expressing human AMH from an Mt1-AMH transgene activated red fluorescence in the M&#252;llerian duct mesenchyme. These results suggest that the 39-kb region used to generate Osx-Cherry contains male-specific M&#252;llerian duct mesenchyme regulatory sequences that are responsive to AMH signaling. These BAC transgenic mouse approaches identify two distinct regions that direct M&#252;llerian duct mesenchyme expression and contribute fundamental knowledge to define a gene regulatory network for sex differentiation.

Dermatomyositis and seronegative immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy are the phenotypes mostly related to cancer. In general, treatment principles in myositis patients with and without CAM are similar. However, some aspects of myositis management are particular to CAM, including (a) the need for a multidisciplinary approach and a close relationship with the oncologist, (b) the presence of immunosuppressive and antineoplastic drug interactions, and (c) the role of the long-term immunosuppressive therapy as a risk factor for cancer relapse or development of a second neoplasm. In this review, we will also discuss immunotherapy in patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors as a treatment for their cancer. Studies on cancer risk in patients treated with long-term immunosuppressive drugs, in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis, and in solid organ transplant recipients have shed some light on this topic. Immunotherapy, which has been a great advance for the treatment of some types of malignancy, may be also of interest in CAM, given the special relationship between both disorders.

Identification of potential biomarkers for the two cancers can help us to evaluate their initiation, progression and therapeutic response. In this study, we propose a new microRNA-disease association identification method, BNNRMDA, to discover potential microRNA biomarkers for the two cancers. BNNRMDA better combines disease semantic similarity and Gaussian Association Profile Kernel (GAPK) similarity, microRNA function similarity and GAPK similarity, and the bound nuclear norm regularization model. Compared to other five classical microRNA-disease association identification methods (MIDPE, MIDP, RLSMDA, GRNMF, AND LPLNS), BNNRMDA obtains the highest AUC of 0.9071, demonstrating its strong microRNA-disease association identification performance. BNNRMDA is applied to discover possible microRNA biomarkers for colon cancer and colorectal cancer. The results show that all 73 known microRNAs associated with colon cancer in the HMDD database have the highest association scores with colon cancer and are ranked as top 73. Among 137 known microRNAs associated with colorectal cancer in the HMDD database, 129 microRNAs have the highest association scores with colorectal cancer and are ranked as top 129.

Despite major advances in early detection and treatment modalities, some patients still relapse. The present study proposed a novel immune molecular classification that reflected distinct recurrent risk and therapeutic responses in cervical cancer. Methods: We retrospectively collected two cervical cancer cohorts: TCGA and GSE44001. Consensus clustering approach was conducted based on expression profiling of recurrence- and immune-related genes. The abundance of immune cells was inferred via five algorithms. Immune functions and signatures were quantified through ssGSEA. Genetic mutations were analyzed by maftools package. Immunotherapeutic response was inferred via tumor mutation burden (TMB), Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE), and Submap methods. Finally, we developed a LASSO model for recurrence prediction. Results: Cervical cancer samples were categorized into two immune subtypes (IC1, and IC2). IC2 exhibited better disease free survival (DFS), increased immune cell infiltration within the immune microenvironment, higher expression of immune checkpoints, higher activity of immune-relevant pathways (APC co-inhibition and co-stimulation, inflammation-promoting, MHC class I, IFN response, leukocyte and stromal fractions, macrophage regulation, and TCR Shannon), and higher frequencies of genetic mutations. This molecular classification exhibited a remarkable difference with existing immune subtypes, with diverse PANoptosis (pyroptosis, apoptosis and necroptosis) features. Patients in IC2 were more likely to respond to immunotherapy and targeted, and chemotherapeutic agents. The immune subtype-relevant signature was quantified to predict patients' recurrence risk. Conclusion: Altogether, we developed an immune molecular classification, which can be utilized in clinical practice to aid decision-making on recurrence management. ",

Method: Eligible literatures were retrieved from PubMed, Medline, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and WanFang databases before 1 April 2022. The odds ratios with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals were used to evaluate the strength of these relationships. Sensitivity analysis for publication bias was conducted to assess the stability and reliability of included literatures. Results: A total of 59 SNPs in 11 LncRNAs were summarized for a systematic review in this study, and then, a meta-analysis of rs920778 and rs4759314 polymorphisms in HOTAIR and rs217727 polymorphisms in H19 was conducted. The results demonstrated that rs920778 and rs4759314 polymorphisms were significantly correlated with cervical cancer susceptibility.

Our study aimed to construct a kind of molecular chaperone-related long non-coding RNAs (MCRLncs) marker to accurately predict the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients and find new immunotherapy targets. Methods: In this study, we acquired molecular chaperone genes from two databases, Genecards and molecular signatures database (MsigDB). And then, we downloaded transcriptome data, clinical data, and mutation information of LUAD patients through the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). MCRLncs were determined by Spearman correlation analysis. We used univariate, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate Cox regression analysis to construct risk models. Kaplan-meier (KM) analysis was used to understand the difference in survival between high and low-risk groups. Nomogram, calibration curve, concordance index (C-index) curve, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to evaluate the accuracy of the risk model prediction. In addition, we used gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses to explore the potential biological functions of MCRLncs. Immune microenvironmental landscapes were constructed by using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA), tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) algorithm, \"pRRophetic\" R package, and \"IMvigor210\" dataset. The stem cell index based on mRNAsi expression was used to further evaluate the patient's prognosis. Results: Sixteen MCRLncs were identified as independent prognostic indicators in patients with LUAD. Patients in the high-risk group had significantly worse overall survival (OS). ROC curve suggested that the prognostic features of MCRLncs had a good predictive ability for OS. Immune system activation was more pronounced in the high-risk group. Prognostic features of the high-risk group were strongly associated with exclusion and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF). According to this prognostic model, a total of 15 potential chemotherapeutic agents were screened for the treatment of LUAD. Immunotherapy analysis showed that the selected chemotherapeutic drugs had potential application value. Stem cell index mRNAsi correlates with prognosis in patients with LUAD. Conclusion: Our study established a kind of novel MCRLncs marker that can effectively predict OS in LUAD patients and provided a new model for the application of immunotherapy in clinical practice.

Methods and Results: Multiple tools based on TCGA were used to analyze the differences in the expression of the ARID1B gene, DNA methylation, and its association with various clinicopathological features, somatic mutations, copy number variation, and the prognosis of patients with COAD. According to the analysis results, patients with high mRNA, low methylation levels showed better overall survival than patients with low mRNA, high methylation levels.

DDX5 functions as a coregulator of cellular transcription and splicing, and participates in the processing of small noncoding RNAs. The aberrant regulation of DDX5 expression possibly plays a significant role in the genesis of cancer. However, there are no comprehensive pan-cancer studies on DDX5. This study is the first to conduct a pan-cancer analysis of DDX5 for aiding the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Methods: The gene expression, genetic alterations, protein phosphorylation, promoter methylation, immune infiltration, and enrichment analyses of DDX5 were performed using data retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-tissue Expression (GTEx), Human Protein Atlas (HPA), Tumor Immunological Estimation Resource 2.0 (TIMER2.0), Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), DNA methylation interactive visualization database (DNMIVD), and Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interaction Genes/Proteins (STRING). Data analyses were performed with the R software and other webtools. Results: The expression of DDX5 mRNA decreased significantly in 17 cancer types, but increased significantly in eight cancer types. The enhanced expression of DDX5 mRNA in the tumor samples was related to decreased overall survival (OS), progression-free interval (PFI), and disease-specific survival (DSS) in three cancers, but increased OS, PFI, and DSS in other cancers. The DNA promoter methylation level was significantly reduced in eight cancer types, and there were exceptions in the methylation levels of the DDX5 promoter in four cancer types. The expression of DDX5 mRNA was highly correlated with the infiltration of CD8+ T cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and B cells in a wide variety of malignancies. The findings revealed a strong association between DDX5 and its co-expressed genes in numerous cancer types. Enrichment analysis suggested that DDX5 was associated with multiple cellular pathways, including RNA splicing, Notch signaling pathway, and viral carcinogenesis, which was consistent with the results of previous studies. Conclusion: The findings obtained herein provide further information on the oncogenic potential of DDX5 in diverse tumor types. We propose that DDX5 has important roles in tumor immunity and the diagnosis of cancer. ",

Cuproptosis is a novel cell death mechanism and linked to mitochondrial respiration. However, the role of cuproptosis in colon cancer tumor microenvironment (TME) and immune responses remains unknown. Methods: We conducted difference analysis to identify the differential expressed cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs). According to the CRGs, the TCGA-COAD samples were categorized using consensus clustering. The LASSO regression analysis was utilized to develop the cuproptosis-related signature. We then verified the model reliability by Kaplan-Meier, PCA, and ROC analysis. The GES39582 cohort served as the validation set. GO and KEGG functional analyses were conducted to investigate the underlying mechanism. We compared the infiltration levels of immune cells, the expression levels of immune checkpoints, and microsatellite instability (MSI) status between the high- and low-risk groups. Additionally, the relationships between the risk signature and immune cells and cancer stem cell (CSC) were analyzed. Results: Finally, we identified 9 differentially expressed CRGs in COAD. According to the expression of CRGs, the TCGA-COAD samples were separated into two clusters. The 11-gene signature was established by LASSO, and it had excellent predictive power for COAD prognosis. Besides, we used the GSE39582 cohort to validate the prognostic value of the model.

The prognostic signature combined with potential prognostic factors showed independent prognostic value, reliability, and specificity. Meanwhile, we constructed a risk score-based nomogram to assist clinical decision-making. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that low- and high-risk group were associated with metabolism-related pathways. Our study demonstrated the association between tumor immune cell infiltration based on analyses with the CIBERSORT algorithm and prognostic signature. We also assessed the correlation between prognostic signature and TMB. Lastly, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to validate differentially expressed lncRNAs. The effective prognostic signature based on m7G-related lncRNAs has the potential to predict the survival prognosis of patients with breast cancer. The eight m7G-related lncRNAs identified in this study might represent potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets of breast cancer. ",

        "ArticleTitle": "Establishment of m7G-related gene pair signature to predict overall survival in colorectal cancer. ",
        "AbstractText": "Background: N7-methylguanosine (m7G) is an emerging research hotspot in the field of RNA methylation, and its role in tumor regulation is becoming increasingly recognized. However, its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. Hence, our study explored the role of m7G in CRC. Methods: The mRNA expression data and the corresponding clinical information of the patients with CRC were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A m7G-related gene pair signature was established using the Cox and LASSO regression analyses. A series of in silico analyses based on the signature included analysis of prognosis, correlation analysis, immune-related analysis, and estimation of tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and response to immunotherapy. A nomogram prediction model was then constructed. Results: In total, 2156 m7G-related gene pairs were screened based on 152 m7G-related genes. Then, a prognostic signature of seven gene pairs was constructed, and the patients were stratified into high- or low-risk groups. Better overall survival (OS), left-sided tumor, early stage, immune activity, and low proportion of MSI-low and MSI-high were all associated with a low risk score. High-risk patients had a higher TMB, and patients with a high TMB had a poor OS. Furthermore, the risk score was linked to immune checkpoint expression (including PD-L1), the tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) score, and chemotherapy sensitivity. We also created an accurate nomogram to increase the clinical applicability of the risk score. Conclusion: We identified an m7G pair-based prognostic signature associated with prognosis, immune landscape, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy in CRC. These findings could help us to better understand the role of m7G in CRC, as well as pave the path for novel methods to assess prognosis and design more effective individualized therapeutic strategies.

        "AbstractText": "Background: Recent studies have identified several molecular subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) that have different prognoses to help predict the efficacy of immunotherapy. However, the prognostic prediction is less than satisfactory. Alterations in intracellular copper levels may affect the tumor immune microenvironment and are linked to cancer progression. Previous studies have identified some genes related to cuproptosis. The characteristics of the cuproptosis molecular subtypes have not been thoroughly studied in LUAD. Methods: The transcriptomic data and clinical information of 632 LUAD patients were used to investigate the LUAD molecular subtypes that are associated with the cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs), the tumor immune microenvironment, and stemness. The cuproptosis score was constructed using univariate Cox regression and the minor absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to quantify the prognostic characteristics. Results: Three different molecular subtypes related to cuproptosis, with different prognoses, were identified in LUAD. Cluster A had the highest cuproptosis score and the worst prognosis. Patients in the high cuproptosis score group had a higher somatic mutation frequency and stemness scores. Patients in the low cuproptosis score group had more immune infiltration and better prognosis. Conclusion: Molecular subtypes of LUAD based on CRGs reflect the differences in LUAD patients. The cuproptosis score can be used as a promising biomarker, which is of great significance to distinguish the relationship between cuproptosis and the immune microenvironment. The cuproptosis signature based on the cuproptosis score and clinical characteristics of individual patients will be useful for guiding immunotherapy in LUAD. ",

        "AbstractText": "Background: Breast carcinoma is well recognized to be having the highest global occurrence rate among all cancers, being the leading cause of cancer mortality in females. The aim of this study was to elucidate breast cancer at the genomic and transcriptomic levels in different subtypes so that we can develop more personalized treatments and precision medicine to obtain better outcomes. Method: In this study, an expression profiling dataset downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, GSE45827, was re-analyzed to compare the expression profiles of breast cancer samples in the different subtypes. Using the GEO2R tool, different expression genes were identified. Using the STRING online tool, the protein-protein interaction networks were conducted. Using the Cytoscape software, we found modules, seed genes, and hub genes and performed pathway enrichment analysis. The Kaplan-Meier plotter was used to analyze the overall survival. MicroRNAs and transcription factors targeted different expression genes and were predicted by the Enrichr web server. Result: The analysis of these elements implied that the carcinogenesis and development of triple-negative breast cancer were the most important and complicated in breast carcinoma, occupying the most different expression genes, modules, seed genes, hub genes, and the most complex protein-protein interaction network and signal pathway. In addition, the luminal A subtype might occur in a completely different way from the other three subtypes as the pathways enriched in the luminal A subtype did not overlap with the others. We identified 16 hub genes that were related to good prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer. Moreover, SRSF1 was negatively correlated with overall survival in the Her2 subtype, while in the luminal A subtype, it showed the opposite relationship. Also, in the luminal B subtype, CCNB1 and KIF23 were associated with poor prognosis. Furthermore, new transcription factors and microRNAs were introduced to breast cancer which would shed light upon breast cancer in a new way and provide a novel therapeutic strategy. Conclusion: We preliminarily delved into the potentially comprehensive molecular mechanisms of breast cancer by creating a holistic view at the genomic and transcriptomic levels in different subtypes using computational tools. We also introduced new prognosis-related genes and novel therapeutic strategies and cast new light upon breast cancer. ",

        "AbstractText": "Emerging evidence has uncovered that tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) play significant roles in regulating the tumorigenesis and progression of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). However, the exact composition of TIICs and their prognostic values in ccRCC have not been well defined. A total of 534 ccRCC samples with survival information and TIIC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset were included in our research. The ImmuCellAI tool was employed to estimate the abundance of 24 TIICs and further survival analysis explored the prognostic values of TIICs in ccRCC. In addition, the expression levels of immunosuppressive molecules (PDL1, PD1, LAG3, and CTLA4) in the high- and low-risk groups were explored. Various subtypes of TIICs had distinct infiltrating features and most TIICs exhibited dysregulated abundance between normal and tumor tissues. Moreover, specific kinds of TIICs had encouraging prognostic values in ccRCC. Further analysis constructed a 4-TIICs signature to evaluate the prognosis of ccRCC patients. Cox regression analyses confirmed the independent prognostic role of the signature in ccRCC. Moreover, immunosuppressive molecules, including PD1, LAG3, and CTLA4, were significantly upregulated in the high-risk group and predicted poor prognosis. However, PDL1 was not changed between high- and low-risk groups and could not predict poor prognosis. To sum up, our research explored the landscape of TIICs in ccRCC and established a novel 4-TIIC prognostic signature, which could effectively predict the prognosis for patients with ccRCC. Based on this signature, we also concluded that PDL1 may not predict prognosis in ccRCC. ",

Currently, there is no systematic study on using the glycolysis-related long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) as a model for predicting the survival time in patients with GC. Therefore, it was essential to develop a signature for predicting the survival based on glycolysis-related lncRNA in patients with GC. Materials and methods: LncRNA expression profiles, containing 375 stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) samples, were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The co-expression network of lncRNA and glycolysis-related genes was used to identify the glycolysis-related lncRNAs. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and univariate Cox regression analysis were used to detect the glycolysis-related lncRNA with prognostic significance. Then, Bayesian Lasso-logistic and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to screen the glycolysis-related lncRNA with independent prognostic significance and to develop the risk model. Patients were assigned into the low- and high-risk cohorts according to their risk scores. A nomogram model was constructed based on clinical information and risk scores. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed to visualize the functional and pathway enrichment analyses of the glycolysis-related lncRNA. Finally, the robustness of the results obtained was verified in an internal validation data set. Results: Seven glycolysis-related lncRNAs (AL353804.1, AC010719.1, TNFRSF10A-AS1, AC005586.1, AL355574.1, AC009948.1, and AL161785.1) were obtained to construct a risk model for prognosis prediction in the STAD patients using Lasso regression and multivariate Cox regression analyses. The risk score was identified as an independent prognostic factor for the patients with STAD [HR = 1.315, 95% CI (1.056-1.130), p < 0.001] via multivariate Cox regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn and the area under curve (AUC) values of 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) were calculated to be 0.691, 0.717, and 0.723 respectively. Similar results were obtained in the validation data set. In addition, seven glycolysis-related lncRNAs were significantly enriched in the classical tumor processes and pathways including cell adhesion, positive regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor, leukocyte transendothelial migration, and JAK_STAT signaling pathway. Conclusion: The prognostic prediction model constructed using seven glycolysis-related lncRNA could be used to predict the prognosis in patients with STAD, which might help clinicians in the clinical treatment for STAD.

The various epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of histone acetylation in cancer have attracted increasing attention from scientists. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) also plays an important role in multiple biology processes linked to OC. This study aimed to identify the histone acetylation-related lncRNAs (HARlncRNAs) with respect to the prognosis in OC. We obtained the transcriptome data from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA); HARlncRNAs were first identified by co-expression and differential expression analyses, and then univariate Cox regression and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were used to construct the HARlncRNAs risk signature. Kaplan-Meier analysis, time-dependent receiver operating characteristics (ROC), univariate Cox regression, multivariate Cox regression, nomogram, and calibration were conducted to verify and evaluate the risk signature. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) in risk groups were conducted to explore the tightly correlated pathways with the risk group. A risk signature with 14 HARlncRNAs in OC was finally established and further validated in the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) cohort; the 1-, 3-, and 5-year ROC value, nomogram, and calibration results confirmed the good prediction power of this model. The patients were grouped into high- and low-risk subgroups according to the risk score by the median value. The low-risk group patients exhibited a higher homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) score, LOH_frac_altered, and mutLoad_nonsilent. Furthermore, consensus clustering analysis was employed to divide OC patients into three clusters based on the expression of the 14 HARlncRNAs, which presented different survival probabilities. Principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) were also performed to evaluate the three clusters. In conclusion, the risk signature composed of 14 HARlncRNAs might function as biomarkers and prognostic indicators with respect to predicting the response to the anti-cancer drugs in OC. ",

This study aimed to examine the function of PARP10 in OSCC and investigate the underlying mechanisms. Methods: The expression of PARP10 in OSCC was investigated in OSCC patient cohorts. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis was performed to assess the association between PARP10 and prognosis in OSCC. Correlation between PARP10 expression and the related variables was analyzed by &#967;2 test. CKK-8, transwell assay, western blot, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and bioinformatic analysis, were applied to clarify the role of PARP10 in OSCC. Results: PARP10 was found to be markedly elevated in OSCC tissues. The upregulation of PARP10 predicted shorter overall survival and disease-specific survival and was significantly correlated with several malignant features. Moreover, depletion of PARP10 markedly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of OSCC cells, and promoted OSCC cell apoptosis, and resulted in alterations of relevant proteins. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between the expression of PARP10 and Ki67, PARP1, MMP2, and VEGF. In addition, depletion of PARP10 impaired the PI3K-AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. Conclusion: PARP10 is involved in the progression of OSCC via regulation of PI3K-AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. ",

However, the gene signature and prognostic value of m6A regulators and m6A-associated RNAs in regulating sarcoma (SARC) development and progression remain largely unexplored. Therefore, further research is required. Methods: We obtained expression data for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and miRNAs of SARC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets. Correlation analysis and two target gene prediction databases (miRTarBase and LncBase v.2) were used to deduce m6A-related miRNAs and lncRNAs, and Cytoscape software was used to construct ceRNA-regulating networks. Based on univariate Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analyses, an m6A-associated RNA risk signature (m6Ascore) model was established. Prognostic differences between subgroups were explored using Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis. Risk score-related biological phenotypes were analyzed in terms of functional enrichment, tumor immune signature, and tumor mutation signature. Finally, potential immunotherapy features and drug sensitivity predictions for this model were also discussed. Results: A total of 16 miRNAs, 104 lncRNAs, and 11 mRNAs were incorporated into the ceRNA network. The risk score was obtained based on RP11-283I3.6, hsa-miR-455-3p, and CBLL1. Patients were divided into two risk groups using the risk score, with patients in the low-risk group having longer overall survival (OS) than those in the high-risk group. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves indicated that risk characteristic performed well in predicting the prognosis of patients with SARC. In addition, lower m6Ascore was also positively correlated with the abundance of immune cells such as monocytes and mast cells activated, and several immune checkpoint genes were highly expressed in the low-m6Ascore group. According to our analysis, lower m6Ascore may lead to better immunotherapy response and OS outcomes. The risk signature was significantly associated with the chemosensitivity of SARC. Finally, a nomogram was constructed to predict the OS in patients with SARC. The concordance index (C-index) for the nomogram was 0.744 (95% CI: 0.707-0.784). The decision curve analysis (DCA), calibration plot, and ROC curve all showed that this nomogram had good predictive performance. Conclusion: This m6Ascore risk model based on m6A RNA methylation regulator-related RNAs may be promising for clinical prediction of prognosis and might contain potential biomarkers for treatment response prediction for SARC patients.

We aimed to assess the effect of a pre-exposure to non-ionizing RF radiation on survival, weight changes, food consumption, and water intake of lethally irradiated rats. In this case-control study, we used a commercial mobile phone (GSM, 900/1800 MHz) as well as a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi router as the sources of pre-exposure to RF radiation. Forty-eight rats were randomly divided into six groups of control, \"8 Gy X-rays\", mobile phone, \"mobile phone+8 Gy\", Wi-Fi, and \"Wi-Fi+8 Gy\". Then, the survival fraction, weight loss, water, and food consumption changes were compared in different groups. The survival analysis indicated that the survival rates in all of the exposed animals (\"8 Gy X-rays\", \"mobile phone+8 Gy\", \"Wi-Fi+8 Gy\") were significantly lower than the control, \"Wi-Fi\", and \"mobile phone\" groups. The changes in survival rates of \"mobile+8 Gy\", \"Wi-Fi+8 Gy\", and 8 Gy alone were not statistically significant. However, food and water intake were significantly affected by exposure to both RF pre-exposures and exposure to high dose ionizing radiation. To the best of our knowledge, the existence of a dose window for the induction of AR can be the cause of the lack of AR in our experiment. Our findings confirm that in a similar pattern with the adaptive responses induced by pre-exposure to ionizing radiation, the induction of adaptive response by RF-pre-exposures requires a minimum level of damage to trigger adaptive phenomena.

Our on-going studies on this gel have shown it to be a complex mixture of several biologically active molecules. Anti-cancer studies on lipid fractions isolated from the gel-like materials showed them to be active against several cancer cell lines. This prompted us to investigate further the lipid composition of the catfish epidermal gel secretions (EGS). Analysis of the lipid fraction of EGS resulted in identification of 12 oxysterols including cholesterol and 2 deoxygenated steroids i.e., 7&#945;-hydroxy cholesterol, 7&#946;-hydroxycholesterol, 5,6 epoxycholesterol, 3&#946;-hydroxycholest-5-ene-7-one and cholesta-3,5-dien-7-one. Progesterone, cholest-3,5-diene, cholesta-2,4-diene, cholest-3,5,6-triol and 4-cholesten-3-one were found as minor components, and were identified through their MS, 1HNMR and FTIR spectral data and were compared with those of the standards. Cholest-3,6-dione, cholesta-4,6-diene-3-one, cholesta-2,4-diene, and cholesta-5,20(22)-dien-3-ol were found only in trace amounts and were identified by GC/MS/MS spectral data. Since cholesterol is the major component of EGS, the identified oxysterols (OS) are presumably cholesterol oxidation products. Many of the identified OS are known important biological molecules that play vital physiological role in the producer and recipient organisms. We report herein the effects of these sterols on three human cancer cell lines in vitro, i.e., K-562 (CML cell line), MDA MB-231 (estrogen positive breast cancer cell line) and MCF-7 (estrogen negative breast cancer cell line). Interestingly significant (p < 0.05) dose differences were observed between tested OS on cell types used. The presence of these sterols in EGS may help explain some aspects of the physiological activities of fraction B (FB) prepared from EGS, such as enhanced wound and diabetic ulcer healing, anti-inflammatory action and cytotoxic activities reported in our previous studies. The anti-proliferative actions of some of these oxysterols especially the cholesterol 3,5,6-triol (#5) as established on selected cancer cell lines in this study support our previous studies and make them candidates for research for human application.

Thereafter, we created a prognostic lncRNA-based model using LASSO. Kaplan-Meier assessment, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyzation, independent prognostic investigation, and nomogram were used to assess model correctness. Additional research included evaluations of the immunological microenvironment, gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA), tumor mutation burdens (TMBs), tumor immune dysfunctions and exclusions (TIDEs), and antitumor compounds IC50 predictions. We found 24 ICD-related lncRNAs with prognostic value via univariate Cox analysis (p < 0.05). Subsequently, a risk model was proposed using five lncRNAs relevant to ICD. The risk signature, correlated with immune cell infiltration, had strong predictive performance. Individuals at low-risk group outlived those at high risk (p < 0.001). An evaluation of the 5-lncRNA risk mode including ROC curves, nomograms, and correction curves confirmed its predictive capability. The findings of functional tests revealed a substantial alteration in immunological conditions and the IC50 sensitivity for the two groups. Using five ICD-related lncRNAs, the authors developed a new risk model for STAD patients that could predict their cumulative overall survival rate and guide their individual treatment. ",

        "ArticleTitle": "Research progress of ginseng in the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers. ",
        "AbstractText": "Cancer has become one of the major causes of human death. Several anticancer drugs are available; howeve their use and efficacy are limited by the toxic side effects and drug resistance caused by their continuous application. Many natural products have antitumor effects with low toxicity and fewer adverse effects. Moreover, they play an important role in enhancing the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents, reducing toxic side effects, and reversing chemoresistance. Consequently, natural drugs are being applied as potential therapeutic options in the field of antitumor treatment. As natural medicinal plants, some components of ginseng have been shown to have excellent efficacy and a good safety profile for cancer treatment. The pharmacological activities and possible mechanisms of action of ginseng have been identified. Its broad range of pharmacological activities includes antitumor, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-stress, anti-fibrotic, central nervous system modulating, cardioprotective, and immune-enhancing effects. Numerous studies have also shown that throuth multiple pathways, ginseng and its active ingredients exert antitumor effects on gastrointestinal (GI) tract tumors, such as esophageal, gastric, colorectal, liver, and pancreatic cancers. Herein, we introduced the main components of ginseng, including ginsenosides, polysaccharides, and sterols, etc., and reviewed the mechanism of action and research progress of ginseng in the treatment of various GI tumors. Futhermore, the pathways of action of the main components of ginseng are discussed in depth to promote the clinical development and application of ginseng in the field of anti-GI tumors. ",

        "ArticleTitle": "Integrated network pharmacology and experimental analysis unveil multi-targeted effect of 18&#945;- glycyrrhetinic acid against non-small cell lung cancer. ",
        "AbstractText": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most malignant types of cancer with soaring incidence rates worldwide, attributed to its heterogeneity and complex etiology. Evidently, alternative anti-cancer therapies comprising traditional medicines and natural products have gained attention for their ability to act as chemopreventive agents with minimal toxicities, either alone or in combination. Accumulating studies have substantiated the inevitability of network pharmacology studies for effectively mapping molecular targets of natural products against multifaceted diseases, including cancer. The 18&#945;-Glycyrrhetinic acid (18&#945;-GA), a triterpenoid found in licorice plants, has shown promising medicinal properties, although, its mechanism of action against NSCLC yet remains elusive. The present study was conducted to explore the anti- NSCLC potential of 18&#945;-GA, employing integrative network pharmacology, molecular docking, and experimental research. Initially, network analysis revealed 181 common targets of 18&#945;-GA in NSCLC as shown in the \"compound-target- disease\" network employing Cytoscape 3.8.2. Further analyses identified EGFR, AKT1, PI3KR1, MAPK1, IGF1, and SRC as the most crucial hub targets of 18&#945;-GA against NSCLC. Moreover, molecular docking simulations and functional enrichment analyses indicated the involvement of multiple signaling pathways in suppressing NSCLC. Subsequent in-vitro studies verified the antiproliferative effect of 18&#945;-GA on two NSCLC cancer cell lines, H1299 and A549. Mechanistically, 18&#945;-GA arrested cell cycle at the G1 phase, induced apoptosis, decreased migratory potential, and protein expression levels of EGFR-PI3K/AKT, as examined by flow cytometry, morphological assessment, RT-PCR, and western blot. In conclusion, this study delineates the therapeutic potential and underlying mechanism(s) of 18&#945;-GA as a putative novel drug against NSCLC. However, further studies are warranted to elucidate the complete molecular mechanism(s) using animal models of NSCLC. ",

        "AbstractText": "Prostate cancer (PCa) ranks as one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies worldwide. Toxicity, lack of clinical efficacy, and development of resistance phenotypes are the main challenges in the control of prostate malignancies. Notably, castration-resistance prostate cancer (CRPCa) is a highly aggressive and metastatic phenotype of the disease with a poor prognosis and very limited therapeutic options. Herein, we report the isolation and genotypic identification of a soil-derived fungus Aspergillus neoniveus using the PCR-based internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region amplification approach. HPLC/MS investigation of the metabolic profile of the ethyl acetate extract from the fungal biomass revealed tentative identification of forty-five compounds belonging to various chemical classes including &#947;-butyrolactones, alkaloids, phenolics, and quinoids. Furthermore, the chromatographic purification of microbial extract enabled the identification of nervonic acid methyl ester (1) for the first time from endophytic fungi, as well as acetyl aszonalenin (2), and butyrolactone II (3) for the first time from A. neoniveus. The chemical frameworks of the isolated compounds were identified via extensive spectral analysis including 1 and 2D NMR and MS. The X-ray crystal structure and absolute configuration of acetyl aszonalenin (2) were also determined. Additionally, screening of in vitro anticancer activity of the fungal extract revealed its potential antiproliferative and anti-migratory activities against five different prostate cancer cells (PC3, PC-3M, DU-145, CWR-R1ca, and 22Rv1), including different cells with the castration-resistance phenotype. Moreover, the isolated metabolites significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and colonization of human prostate cancer cells at low micromolar levels, thus providing credence for future investigation of these metabolites in relevant anti-prostate cancer animal models. Furthermore, computational target prediction tools identified the cannabinoid G-protein coupled receptors type 1 (CB1) as a potential biological target mediating, at least in part, the anticancer effects of acetylaszonalenin (2). Moreover, molecular modeling and docking studies revealed a favorable binding pose at the CB1 receptor orthosteric ligand pocket aided by multiple polar and hydrophobic interactions with critical amino acids. In conclusion, the Aspergillus neoniveus-derived prenylated indole alkaloid acetylaszonalenin has promising anticancer activity and is amenable to further hit-to-lead optimization for the control of prostate malignancies via modulating CB1 receptors.

However, systematically elucidating its mechanisms of action remains a great challenge to the field. In this study, taking advantage of the network pharmacology approach, we discovered a potential new use of HGWD for patients with colon cancer (CC). Our in vivo result showed that orally administered HGWD markedly inhibited the growth of CC xenografts in mice. The subsequent enrichment analyses for the core therapeutic targets revealed that HGWD could affect multiple biological processes involving CC growth, such as metabolic reprogramming, apoptosis and immune regulation, through inhibiting multiple cell survival-related signalings, including MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways. Notably, these in silico analysis results were most experimentally verified by a series of in vitro assays. Furthermore, our results based on serum metabolomics showed that the lipid metabolic pathways, including fatty acid biosynthesis and cholesterol metabolism, play key roles in delivery of the anti-CC effect of HGWD on tumor-bearing mice, and that cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily E member 1 (CYP2E1) is a potential therapeutic target. Together, our integrated approach reveals a therapeutic effect of HGWD on CC, providing a valuable insight into developing strategies to predict and interpret the mechanisms of action for Chinese herbal decoctions.

To advance our understanding of disease mechanisms and our ability to treat these diseases, it is critical to delineate the molecular basis and therapeutic avenues of specific disease phenotypes, especially those that are associated with multiple diseases. Inflammatory processes constitute one such prominent phenotype, being involved in a wide range of health problems including ischemic heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and autoimmune and neurodegenerative conditions. While hundreds of genes might play a role in the etiology of each of these diseases, isolating the genes involved in the specific phenotype (e.g., inflammation \"component\") could help us understand the genes and pathways underlying this phenotype across diseases and predict potential drugs to target the phenotype. Here, we present a computational approach that integrates gene interaction networks, disease-/trait-gene associations, and drug-target information to accomplish this goal.

However, the action and pharmacological mechanism of ECD remain largely unclear. In the present study, we explored the effects and mechanisms of ECD in the treatment of CRC using network pharmacology, molecular docking, and systematic experimental validation. Methods: The active components of ECD were obtained from the TCMSP database and the potential targets of them were annotated by the STRING database. The CRC-related targets were identified from different databases (OMIM, DisGeNet, GeneCards, and DrugBank). The interactive targets of ECD and CRC were screened and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed. Then, the hub interactive targets were calculated and visualized from the PPI network using the Cytoscape software. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed. In addition, the molecular docking was performed. Finally, systematic in vitro, in vivo and molecular biology experiments were performed to further explore the anti-tumor effects and underlying mechanisms of ECD in CRC. Results: A total of 116 active components and 246 targets of ECD were predicted based on the component-target network analysis. 2406 CRC-related targets were obtained from different databases and 140 intersective targets were identified between ECD and CRC. 12 hub molecules (STAT3, JUN, MAPK3, TP53, MAPK1, RELA, FOS, ESR1, IL6, MAPK14, MYC, and CDKN1A) were finally screened from PPI network. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses demonstrated that the biological discrepancy was mainly focused on the tumorigenesis-, immune-, and mechanism-related pathways. Based on the experimental validation, ECD could suppress the proliferation of CRC cells by inhibiting cell cycle and promoting cell apoptosis. In addition, ECD could inhibit tumor growth in mice. Finally, the results of molecular biology experiments suggested ECD could regulate the transcriptional levels of several hub molecules during the development of CRC, including MAPKs, PPARs, TP53, and STATs. Conclusion: This study revealed the potential pharmacodynamic material basis and underlying molecular mechanisms of ECD in the treatment of CRC, providing a novel insight for us to find more effective anti-CRC drugs.

        "AbstractText": "CCT3 played a key role in many cancers. This study aimed to further explore the characteristics of CCT3 from a pan-cancer perspective and reveal the driving forces for CCT3. By bioinformatic analysis, we found that the mRNA and protein levels of CCT3 were abnormally elevated in most tumor types and were correlated with poor prognosis. Single-cell sequencing data indicated an abnormal increase of CCT3 expression in both malignant cells and multiple immune cells. In the tumor microenvironment, CCT3 expression was negatively relevant with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint genes expression. In colon cancer, knockdown of CCT3 inhibited cell proliferation. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that CCT3 may be oncogenic by regulating amino acid metabolism. Furthermore, we predicted sensitive drugs for CCT3 by virtual screening and sensitivity analysis. Many driver genes such as TP53 and KRAS were essential for CCT3 overexpression. Epigenetic factors, enhancers in particular, were also critical for CCT3 expression. Additionally, we constructed the lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-CCT3 regulatory network. Collectively, CCT3 had the potential to be a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for multiple tumor types. CCT3 expression was relevant with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. CCT3 could be a new molecular target for colon cancer. Both genetic and epigenetic factors were responsible for CCT3 expression in tumors. ",

Here, we established a matrigel-based 3D micro-tumor model on an array chip for large-scale anticancer drug evaluation.

Next, the results of the chemotherapeutic evaluation from 18 drugs against 27 cancer cell lines showed 17.6% of drug resistance on the 3D tumor model. Moreover, the evaluation results of targeted drugs showed expected sensitivity and higher specificity on the 3D tumor model compared with the 2D model. Finally, the evaluation results on the 3D tumor model were more consistent with the in vivo cell-derived xenograft model, and excluded 95% false-positive results from the 2D model.

To provide a reference range for the biosafety dose of CuS-BSA NPs, 36 male Kunming mice were randomly assigned into six groups. Different one-time doses of CuS-BSA NPs were injected via tail vein injection, and the potential damages of liver, kidney and spleen were observed 14&#160;days later. To evaluate the in vivo photothermal effect of CuS-BSA NPs, 48 male Kunming mice were used to establish the H22 hepatoma-bearing mouse model and were randomly assigned into six groups. CuS-BSA NPs (600&#160;&#956;g/kg) were injected via tail vein or intratumoral injection.

It has been reported that a secretory phospholipase A2 known as A2-EPTX-NSm1a has lower cytotoxicity in neuronal cells compared to its crude Naja sumatrana venom. In this study, A2-EPTX-NSm1a was tested for its neuroprotective activity on human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) differentiated into cholinergic neurons against oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). H2O2 treatment alone increased the caspase-3 and caspase-8 activities, whereas pre-treatment with A2-EPTX-NSm1a reduced the activity of these apoptosis-associated proteins. Moreover, A2-EPTX-NSm1a protects the morphology and ultrastructure of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells in the presence of H2O2. Oxidative stress increased the number of small mitochondria. Further evaluation showed the size of mitochondria with a length below 0.25&#160;&#181;m in oxidative stress conditions is higher than the control group, suggesting mitochondria fragmentation. Pre-treatment with A2-EPTX-NSm1a attenuated the number of mitochondria in cells with H2O2 Furthermore, A2-EPTX-NSm1a altered the expression of several neuroprotein biomarkers of GDNF, IL-8, MCP-1, TIMP-1, and TNF-R1 in cells under oxidative stress induced by H2O2.

Moreover, the Hallmark enticement analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between low- and high-risk groups was performed as well. Immunohistochemistry staining was used to evaluate NEUROD1 expression. As result, different kinds of TILs had distinct infiltrating features. In addition, Specific TILs subsets had notable prognostic values in PaCa. We further established a 6-TILs signature to assess the prognosis of PaCa patients. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses both suggested the significant prognostic value of the signature in PaCa. Based on the prognostic signature, we screened a great deal of potential prognostic biomarkers and successfully validated NEUROD1 as a novel prognostic biomarker in PaCa. Overall, the current study illuminated the immune cells infiltrating the landscape in PaCa and identified a TILs-dependent signature and NEUROD1 for prognostic prediction in PaCa patients. ",

        "ArticleTitle": "Exploring the druggability of the binding site of aurovertin, an exogenous allosteric inhibitor of FOF1-ATP synthase. ",
        "AbstractText": "In addition to playing a central role in the mitochondria as the main producer of ATP, FOF1-ATP synthase performs diverse key regulatory functions in the cell membrane. Its malfunction has been linked to a growing number of human diseases, including hypertension, atherosclerosis, cancer, and some neurodegenerative, autoimmune, and aging diseases. Furthermore, inhibition of this enzyme jeopardizes the survival of several bacterial pathogens of public health concern. Therefore, FOF1-ATP synthase has emerged as a novel drug target both to treat human diseases and to combat antibiotic resistance. In this work, we carried out a computational characterization of the binding sites of the fungal antibiotic aurovertin in the bovine F1 subcomplex, which shares a large identity with the human enzyme. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that although the binding sites can be described as preformed, the inhibitor hinders inter-subunit communications and exerts long-range effects on the dynamics of the catalytic site residues. End-point binding free energy calculations revealed hot spot residues for aurovertin recognition. These residues were also relevant to stabilize solvent sites determined from mixed-solvent molecular dynamics, which mimic the interaction between aurovertin and the enzyme, and could be used as pharmacophore constraints in virtual screening campaigns. To explore the possibility of finding species-specific inhibitors targeting the aurovertin binding site, we performed free energy calculations for two bacterial enzymes with experimentally solved 3D structures. Finally, an analysis of bacterial sequences was carried out to determine conservation of the aurovertin binding site. Taken together, our results constitute a first step in paving the way for structure-based development of new allosteric drugs targeting FOF1-ATP synthase sites of exogenous inhibitors. ",

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been extensively used to treat cancer due to its multiple targets, minimum side effects and potent therapeutic effects, and thus plays an important role in all stages of tumor therapy. With the continuous progress in cancer treatment, the overall efficacy of cancer therapy has been significantly improved, and the survival time of patients has been dramatically prolonged. In recent years, a series of advanced technologies, including nanotechnology, gene editing technology, real-time cell-based assay (RTCA) technology, and flow cytometry analysis technology, have been developed and applied to study TCM for cancer therapy, which efficiently improve the medicinal value of TCM and accelerate the research progress of TCM in cancer therapy. Therefore, the applications of these advanced technologies in TCM for cancer therapy are summarized in this review. We hope this review will provide a good guidance for TCM in cancer therapy. ",

        "AbstractText": "Metastasis is responsible for 90% of deaths in cancer patients. Most patients diagnosed with metastatic cancer will die within 5 years. PA is good for health and has become an emerging adjuvant therapy for cancer survivors. Regular moderate exercise substantially lowers the incidence and recurrence of several cancers, alleviates cancer-related adverse events, enhances the efficacy of anti-cancer treatments, and improves the quality of life of cancer patients. Revealing the mechanisms of PA inhibiting tumor metastasis could upgrade our understanding of cancer biology and help researchers explore new therapeutic strategies to improve survival in cancer patients. However, it remains poorly understood how physical activity prevents metastasis by modulating tumor behavior. The immune system is involved in each step of tumor metastasis. From invasion to colonization, immune cells interact with tumor cells to secret cytokines and proteases to remodel the tumor microenvironment. Substantial studies demonstrated the ability of physical activity to induce antitumor effects of immune cells. This provides the possibility that physical activity can modulate immune cells behavior to attenuate tumor metastasis. The purpose of this review is to discuss and summarize the critical link between immune function and exercise in metastasis prevention. ",

However, these drugs are only effective in some ccRCC patients, and can produce a wide range of immune-related adverse reactions. Previous studies have found that ccRCC is different from other tumors, and common biomarkers such as tumor mutational burden, HLA type, and degree of immunological infiltration cannot predict the response of ccRCC to immunotherapy. Therefore, it is necessary to further research and construct corresponding clinical prediction models to predict the efficacy of Immune checkpoint inhibitors. We integrated PBRM1 mutation data, transcriptome data, endogenous retrovirus data, and gene copy number data from 123 patients with advanced ccRCC who participated in prospective clinical trials of PD-1 inhibitors (including CheckMate 009, CheckMate 010, and CheckMate 025 trials). We used AI to optimize mutation data interpretation and established clinical prediction models for survival (for overall survival AUC: 0.931; for progression-free survival AUC: 0.795) and response (ORR AUC: 0.763) to immunotherapy of ccRCC. The models were internally validated by bootstrap. Well-fitted calibration curves were also generated for the nomogram models.

        "AbstractText": "Chronic inflammation plays a pivotal role in cancer development. Cancer cells interact with adjacent cellular components (pro-inflammatory cells, intrinsic immune cells, stromal cells, etc.) and non-cellular components to form the inflammatory tumor microenvironment (TME). Interleukin 6 (IL-6), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), immune checkpoint factors and other pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by intrinsic immune cells in TME are the main mediators of intercellular communication in TME, which link chronic inflammation to cancer by stimulating different oncogenic signaling pathways and improving immune escape to promote cancer development. In parallel, the ability of monocytes, T regulatory cells (Tregs) and B regulatory cells (Bregs) to perform homeostatic tolerogenic functions is hijacked by cancer cells, leading to local or systemic immunosuppression. Standard treatments for advanced malignancies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy have improved in the last decades. However, clinical outcomes of certain malignant cancers are not satisfactory due to drug resistance and side effects. The clinical application of immune checkpoint therapy (ICT) has brought hope to cancer treatment, although therapeutic efficacy are still limited due to the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Emerging evidences reveal that ideal therapies including clearance of tumor cells, disruption of tumor-induced immunosuppression by targeting suppressive TME as well as reactivation of anti-tumor T cells by ICT. Here, we review the impacts of the major pro-inflammatory cells, mediators and their downstream signaling molecules in TME on cancer development. We also discuss the application of targeting important components in the TME in the clinical management of cancer. ",

        "AbstractText": "Animal data show that the presence of an oncogenic Kras mutation in pancreatic acinar cells leads to acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM), pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Inflammatory macrophages play an important role in the formation of ADMs and transition to PanINs. Epidemiologically, statins are associated with a reduced risk of PDAC. We investigated whether statins inhibit inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages and whether this leads to reduced ADM formation. The efficacy of statins on inflammatory cytokine production in 2 macrophage cell lines was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effect of macrophage-conditioned medium on ADM in primary pancreatic acinar cells was investigated. Mouse pancreatic tissue samples were analyzed for macrophage numbers, cytokine levels, and neoplastic/dysplastic area. Lipophilic statins prevented inflammatory cytokine production in Raw264.7 and J774A.1 cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide. The inhibitory effect of statins was mediated by inhibition of mevalonate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthesis and disruption of the actin cytoskeleton but not by a reduction in intracellular cholesterol. Treatment of macrophages with lipophilic statins also blocked ADM formation of primary pancreatic acinar cells. Furthermore, oral administration of simvastatin was associated with a reduction in the number of intrapancreatic macrophages, decreased inflammatory cytokine levels in the pancreas, and attenuated ADM/PanIN formation in mice. Our data support the hypothesis that statins oppose early PDAC development by their effects on macrophages and ADM formation. The inhibitory actions of statins on macrophages may collaborate with direct inhibitory effects on transformed pancreatic epithelial cells, which cumulatively may reduce early PDAC development and progression.

Previously, we showed the anticancer effects of Thai herbal plant extract, Dioscorea membranacea Pierre (DM), in HCC-bearing rats. In the present study, we further examined the proposed mechanism of DM, including apoptosis and antioxidant activity. Moreover, we used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to analyze molecular pathways in the rat model in which HCC was induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and thioacetamide (TAA). The HCC-bearing rats were then treated with 40 mg/kg of DM for 8 weeks, after which experimental and control rats were sacrificed and liver tissues were collected. The RNA-seq data of DEN/TAA-treated rats exhibited upregulation of 16 hallmark pathways, including epithelial mesenchymal transition, inflammatory responses, and angiogenesis (p<0.01). DM extract expanded the Bax protein-positive pericentral zone in the tumor areas and decreased hepatic malondialdehyde levels, implying a decrease in lipid peroxidation in liver. However, DM treatment did not ameliorate the molecular pathways induced in DEN/TAA-treated livers.

        "AbstractText": "Human bladder cancer (BCa) exhibits morphological and molecular heterogeneity which can complicate treatment. Morphologically, more than 90% of BCa is classified as urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC). Among other histological variants, UCC with squamous differentiation (SqD) shows a worse prognosis than pure UCC. In addition, basal-squamous BCa is enriched for SqD, and these tumors have a poor prognosis. Therefore, it is critical to elucidate the mechanisms to drive the basal-squamous phenotype of human BCa. Laminin-332 is a major glycoprotein of the epithelial basement membrane. It is well known that laminin-332 is a favorable target for extracellular matrix proteases such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in various diseases. Accumulating evidence indicates the significant role of laminin-332 in tumorigenesis. Here, we analyzed the expression of laminin-332 genes (LAMA3, LAMB3, LAMC2) in molecular subtypes of human BCa using publicly available data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Additionally, we also used q-RT-PCR to characterize laminin-332 gene expression between distinct molecular subtypes of human BCa cell lines. Our analysis of publicly available data show that laminin-332 genes are highly expressed in the basal-squamous molecular subtype of human BCa. In addition, we show laminin-332 genes are highly expressed in basal-squamous human BCa cell lines. Moreover, the expression of both LAMA3 and LAMC2 are negatively correlated with expression of the luminal transcription factor (TF) FOXA1 in the TCGA data. We also demonstrate that laminin-332 genes are downregulated by the overexpression of FOXA1 in a human basal-squamous BCa cell line (5637). Taken together, these results suggest that laminin-332 gene expression may be a biomarker of BCa patients with basal-squamous disease. ",

        "AbstractText": "RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are critical regulators of cellular phenotypes, and dysregulated RBP expression is implicated in various diseases including cancer. A single RBP can bind to and regulate the expression of many RNA molecules via a variety of mechanisms, including translational suppression, prevention of RNA degradation, and alteration in subcellular localization. To elucidate the role of a specific RBP within a given cellular context, it is essential to first identify the group of RNA molecules to which it binds. This has traditionally been achieved using cross-linking-based assays in which cells are first exposed to agents that cross-link RBPs to nucleic acids and then lysed to extract and purify the RBP-nucleic acid complexes. The nucleic acids within the mixture are then released and analyzed via conventional means (e.g., microarray analysis, qRT-PCR, RNA sequencing, or Northern blot). While cross-linking-based ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation (RIP) has proven its utility within some contexts, it is technically challenging, inefficient, and suboptimal given the amount of time and resources (e.g., cells and antibodies) required. Additionally, these types of studies often require the use of over-expressed versions of proteins, which can introduce artifacts. Here, we describe a streamlined version of RIP that utilizes exclusion-based purification technologies. This approach requires significantly less starting material and resources compared to traditional RIP approaches, takes less time, which is tantamount given the labile nature of RNA, and can be used with endogenously expressed proteins.

Here, we present a drug screening protocol utilizing gastrulation of zebrafish embryos for identification of anti-metastasis drugs. Based on the evidence that metastasis proceeds through utilizing the molecular mechanisms of gastrulation, we hypothesized that chemicals interrupting zebrafish gastrulation might suppress the metastasis of cancer cells. Thus, we developed a phenotype-based chemical screen that uses epiboly, the first morphogenetic movement in gastrulation, as a marker. The screen only needs zebrafish embryos and enables hundreds of chemicals to be tested in five hours by observing the epiboly progression of chemical-treated embryos. In the screen, embryos at the two-cell stage are firstly corrected and then developed to the sphere stage. The embryos are treated with a test chemical and incubated in the presence of the chemical until vehicle-treated embryos develop to the 90% epiboly stage. Finally, positive 'hit' chemicals that interrupt epiboly progression are selected by comparing epiboly progression of the chemical-treated and vehicle-treated embryos under a stereoscopic microscope. A previous study subjected 1,280 FDA-approved drugs to the screen and identified adrenosterone and pizotifen as epiboly-interrupting drugs. These were validated to suppress metastasis of breast cancer cells in mice models of metastasis. Furthermore, 11&#946;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (HSD11&#946;1) and serotonin receptor 2C (HTR2C), the primary targets of adrenosterone and pizotifen, respectively, promoted metastasis through induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).

The data from TCGA-KIRC, ICGC, GEO, Oncomine, ArrayExpress, TIMER, HPA datasets, and our clinical samples were used to determine and validate the expression level, prognostic roles, and potentially immune-related mechanisms in ccRCC. Cell function assays were performed to investigate the biological role of FXYD2 in vitro. FXYD2 was identified to be downregulated in ccRCC tissue compared to normal tissue, which was confirmed by our RT-PCR, WB, and IHC analyses. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression analysis suggested that downregulated FXYD2 could independently predict poor survival of ccRCC patients. Through the ESTIMATE algorithm, ssGSEA algorithm, CIBERSORT algorithm, TIMER database, and our laboratory experiment, FXYD2 was found to correlate with the immune landscape, especially regulatory T cells (Treg), in ccRCC. Gain-of-function experiment revealed that FXYD2 could restrain cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. Functional enrichment analysis illustrated that TGF-&#946;-SMAD2/3, Notch, and PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathways may be potential signaling pathways of FXYD2 in ccRCC. Downregulation of FXYD2 is associated with ccRCC tumorigenesis, poor prognosis, and increased Treg infiltration in ccRCC, which may be related to TGF-&#946;-SMAD2/3, Notch, and PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathways. This will probably provide a novel prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target for ccRCC. ",

        "AbstractText": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and second leading cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent newly discovered mode of cell death, can be induced by lenaltinib and plays an important role in the biological behaviors of BC. Therefore, the prognostic value of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in BC warrants further investigation. FRG expression profiles and clinical data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Immune-related pathways were found in the functional analysis. Significant differences in enrichment scores for immune cells were observed. Some patients from TCGA-BRCA were included as the training cohort. A six-gene prediction signature was constructed with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression. This model was validated in the rest of the TCGA-BRCA and GEO cohort. The expressions of the six FRGs were verified with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry in the Human Protein Atlas. Relapse or metastasis was more likely in the high-risk group. Risk score was an independent predictor of disease-free survival. Collectively, the ferroptosis-related risk model established in this study may serve as an effective tool to predict the prognosis in BC. ",

        "AbstractText": "Immune stimulating agents like Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonists induce potent antitumor immunity but are limited in their therapeutic window due to off-target immune activation. Here, we developed a polymeric delivery platform that binds excess unpaired cysteines on tumor cell surfaces and debris to adjuvant tumor neoantigens as an in situ vaccine. The metabolic and enzymatic dysregulation in the tumor microenvironment produces these exofacial free thiols, which can undergo efficient disulfide exchange with thiol-reactive pyridyl disulfide moieties upon intratumoral injection. These functional monomers are incorporated into a copolymer with pendant mannose groups and TLR7 agonists to target both antigen and adjuvant to antigen presenting cells. When tethered in the tumor, the polymeric glyco-adjuvant induces a robust antitumor response and prolongs survival of tumor-bearing mice, including in checkpoint-resistant B16F10 melanoma. The construct additionally reduces systemic toxicity associated with clinically relevant small molecule TLR7 agonists. ",

A pair of positional glycan isomers (LDN3 and LDN6), a nonelongated GlcNAc4Man3 N-glycan (G0), and the minimum binding epitope (the GlcNAc&#946;1-2Man disaccharide) have been used to shed light on the preferred binding modes under both experimental conditions. Strikingly, both asymmetric LDN3 and LDN6 N-glycans are recognized by LSECtin with similar affinities in solution, in sharp contrast to the results obtained when those glycans are presented on microarrays, where only LDN6 was efficiently recognized by the lectin. Thus, different results can be obtained using different experimental approaches, pointing out the tremendous difficulty of translating in vitro results to the in vivo environment. ",

However, up to 60% of the patients do not have a sufficient response to treatment and there is a need for optimization of treatment strategies. To investigate if the treatment outcome of biological therapy is associated with the habitual dietary intake of fibre and red/processed meat in patients with a CID. In this multicentre prospective cohort study, we consecutively enrolled 233 adult patients with a diagnosis of Crohn's Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Axial Spondyloarthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis and Psoriasis, for whom biologic therapy was planned, over a 3 year period. Patients with completed baseline food frequency questionnaires were stratified into a high fibre/low red and processed meat exposed group (HFLM) and an unexposed group (low fibre/high red and processed meat intake = LFHM). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a clinical response to biologic therapy after 14-16 weeks of treatment. Of the 193 patients included in our primary analysis, 114 (59%) had a clinical response to biologic therapy. In the HFLM group (N = 64), 41 (64%) patients responded to treatment compared to 73 (56%) in the LFHM group (N = 129), but the difference was not statistically significant (OR: 1.48, 0.72-3.05). For RA patients however, HFLM diet was associated with a more likely clinical response (82% vs. 35%; OR: 9.84, 1.35-71.56). Habitual HFLM intake did not affect the clinical response to biological treatment across CIDs.

Recently, triglyceride glucose-body mass index (TyG-BMI) has been recognized as one of the simple indexes of insulin resistance (IR). However, there are limited data on the relationship between TyG-BMI and NSCLC. Here, we investigated the association of TyG-BMI with NSCLC risk in Chinese adults. This study consisted of 477 NSCLC cases and 954 healthy subjects. All participants were enrolled from 3201 Hospital affiliated to the Medical Department of Xi'an Jiaotong University. TyG-BMI was calculated based on the values of fasting blood glucose, triglyceride, and BMI. The association of TyG-BMI with NSCLC risk was estimated by logistic regression analysis. The mean value of TyG-BMI was statistically increased in patients with NSCLC compared to the control group (201.11 &#177; 28.18 vs. 174 &#177; 23.78, P < 0.01). There was a significant positive association between TyG-BMI and NSCLC (OR = 1.014; 95% CI 1.007-1.021; P < 0.001) after controlling for confounding factors. Moreover, the prevalence of NSCLC was significantly elevated in participants in the high TyG-BMI tertiles than those in the intermediate and low TyG-BMI tertiles (60.46% vs. 12.61% vs. 26.83%, P < 0.01). Importantly, TyG-BMI achieved a significant diagnostic accuracy for NSCLC, with an AUC (area under the curve) of 0.769 and a cutoff value of 184.87. The findings suggest that TyG-BMI is a useful tool for assessing NSCLC risk. Thus, it is essential to follow up on high TyG-BMI, and lifestyle modification is needed to prevent NSCLC in people with high TyG-BMI. ",

EVs are not degraded in the gastrointestinal system and circulation; thus, breast milk EVs (bEVs) are expected to interact with other organs in breastfed infants and modify the gene expression of recipient cells using miRNAs. Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI is a critical factor influencing the composition of breast milk. Thus, in mothers with obesity, miRNAs in bEVs can be altered, which might be associated with adverse health outcomes in infants. In this study, we examined 798 miRNAs to determine which miRNAs are altered in the bEVs of mothers with obesity and their potential impact on breastfed infants. We recruited healthy nursing mothers who were either of normal weight (BMI < 25) or with obesity (BMI &#8805; 30) based on their pre-pregnancy BMI, and delivered a singleton baby in the prior 6 months. EVs were isolated from breast milk with ultracentrifugation. bEV characteristics were examined by flow cytometry and fluorescence imaging of EV markers. A total of 798 miRNAs were screened using a NanoString human miRNA panel to find differentially expressed miRNAs in bEVs of mothers with obesity compared to mothers of normal weight. We included 65 nursing mothers: 47 of normal weight and 18 with obesity based on pre-pregnancy BMI. After bEV isolation, we confirmed the expression of various EV markers. Out of 37 EV markers, CD326 (EpCaM) was the most highly expressed in bEVs. The most abundant miRNAs in bEVs include miR-30b-5p, miR-4454, miR-494-3p, and let-7 miRNAs. Target genes of the top 10 miRNAs were associated with cancer, prolactin pathway, EGFR, ErbB, and FoxO signaling pathway. In bEVs of mothers with obesity, 19 miRNAs were differentially expressed (adjusted p < 0.05 cut-off), which include miR-575, miR-630, miR-642a-3p, and miR-652-5p. These miRNAs and their target genes were associated with neurological diseases and psychological disorders. In this study, we characterized bEVs and demonstrated altered miRNAs in bEVs of mothers with obesity and identified the pathways of their potential target genes.

This work aims to demonstrate the relationship between the phytochemicals of 18 plants and their ability to act as antioxidant/pro-oxidant agents, as well as their effects on the activity of GSTP1-1 and their cellular toxicity. Tamarindus indica, Cinnamomum verum, and Alpinia galanga extracts had high phytochemical contents, moderate heavy metal levels, and antioxidant/pro-oxidant activities. Among the main plant components identified using high-performance liquid chromatography, only chlorogenic acid, catechin, and quercetin can function as antioxidants and pro-oxidants. Hibiscus sabdariffa, C. verum, A. galanga, T. indica, Gossypium arboreum, and Punica granatum were among the plant extracts examined that inhibited the activity of the purified recombinant GSTP1-1, with the inhibition constant values ranging from 0.48 to 1.67 mg of gallic acid equivalent/g. The level of cytotoxicity was also studied to determine the effects of these extracts on human Caucasian breast cancer. The findings revealed that plants with high phenol content had an antioxidant/pro-oxidant capacity as well as inhibition of the activity of GST. However, the cytotoxic effect was not associated with all of the extracts, which indicates that polyphenols interact with other components that may influence their observed behavior. ",

        "AbstractText": "The discovery of immune checkpoints has been well known to provide novel clues for cancer treatments. Immunotherapy against the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) /programmed death-ligand-1 (PD-L1), one of the most popular auxiliary treatments in recent years, has been applied in various tumor treatments, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, inevitable issues such as side effects and drug resistance emerge following the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway may participate in the regulation of PD-L1 expression. Abnormal PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation results in increased PD-L1 protein translation, whereas PD-L1 overexpression can activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inversely. Via downstream proteins, including 4E-BP1, STAT3, NF-&#954;B, c-MYC, and AMPK in aberrant energy status, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway can regulate PD-L1 post-transcription and translation. Besides, the regulation of the PI3K pathway by the PD-1/PD-L1 axis involves both tumor cells and the tumor immune microenvironment. Inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 have been successfully applied in the treatment of gastrointestinal cancer and breast cancer. Meanwhile, drug resistance from alternative pathway activation also evidently affects clinical progress. To achieve a better therapeutic effect and quality of survival, the combination of multiple treatment modalities presents great research value. Here we reviewed the interaction between PD-1/PD-L1 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in the progression and treatment of NSCLC and summarized its clinical implications. The intracellular interactions between PD-1/PD-L1 and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway indicate that PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have a wide range of potential applications. And we presented the mechanism for combining therapy with monoclonal antibody PD-1/PD-L1 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors in this review, to broaden the therapies for NSCLC. ",

The most likely cause for the inconsistence appears due to the fact that basic scientific studies are traditionally conducted on the cell lines and animal models, where it is impossible to completely reflect or replicate the in vivo status. Thus, we would like to propose the human prostate basal cell layer (PBCL) as \"the most effective target for the early detection and intervention of prostate cancer\". Our proposal is based on the morphologic, immunohistochemical and molecular evidence from our recent studies of normal and cancerous human prostate tissues with detailed clinic follow-up data. We believe that the human tissue-derived basic research data may provide a more realistic roadmap to guide the clinic practice and to avoid the potential misleading from in vitro and animal studies.

Further mechanistic studies indicated that the expression levels of Yes-associated protein (YAP) were downregulated in an autophagy-dependent manner after SB treatment. In addition, the SB-induced autophagic degradation of YAP was associated with the anti-metastatic effects of SB in CRPC. In conclusion, the findings of the present study suggested that SB might inhibit the migration, invasion and EMT of PCa cells by regulating the autophagic degradation of YAP, thus representing a potential novel treatment strategy for metastatic CRPC.

        "ArticleTitle": "Early detection of colorectal cancer somatic mutations using cfDNA liquid biopsies in a murine carcinogenesis model. ",
        "AbstractText": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the top five cancers in incidence and mortality worldwide. The early detection of this neoplasm through analysis of circulating free DNA (cfDNA), which carries tumor genetic alterations, as a liquid biopsy, could have a major impact in enhancing early detection and reducing the mortality rate. The aim of this work was to demonstrate the feasibility of using cfDNA as a liquid biopsy for the early detection of CRC. For this purpose, we implemented an azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate-induced murine carcinogenesis model to detect oncogenic somatic mutations in Ctnnb1 and Kras during CRC development. To enhance the sensitivity in the detection, E-ice-COLD-PCR was utilized to selectively enrich for mutant alleles, followed by massively parallel sequencing. Driving somatic mutations were detected in Ctnnb1 and Kras in the liquid biopsies of early stages of tumor development, corresponding to the formation of aberrant crypt foci, the first histological alterations that can be identified throughout the formation of CRC. The concentration of cfDNA was increased along the carcinogenic process. Polyclonality in Ctnnb1 was found in tumor samples and cfDNA in this model. On the other hand, the use of cfDNA as a non-invasive test resulted in superior early detection compared to microPET/CT imaging. As a proof-of-principle, this study shows the great potential use of allelic-specific PCR for the detection and enrichment of pathogenic alleles present in cfDNA samples, as a test for early non-invasive detection of CRC. This work provides scientific evidence to set methodological bases that allow early detection of mutations in cfDNA obtained from plasma of CRC in humans. ",

We aim to investigate the effectiveness of ACT after nCRT with TME plus LLND for patients with clinically suspected LPNM. Methods: From January 2015 to December 2021, 138 patients with clinically suspected LPNM who were treated with nCRT followed by TME plus LLND at three institutions were enrolled in this study. The patients were categorized into the ACT group (n = 95) and the non-ACT group (n = 43). Results: The mean follow-up period was 37 months. The 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate for the entire cohort was 74.8%. Ninety-five patients (68.8%) received ACT, without any oncologic benefit (3-year DFS rates for the ACT and non-ACT groups were 67.0% and 80.5%, respectively, P = 0.130). Additionally, multivariate analysis showed that lymphatic invasion (hazard ratio [HR]: 6.26, P = 0.005) was an independent risk factor for DFS. Subgroup analyses revealed that for patients &#8805; 64 years and those with ypStage 0, the distribution of 95% confidence interval (CI) values tended to focus on the non-ACT strategy. Conclusion: The efficacy of the addition of ACT to TME plus LLND after nCRT in LARC patients with clinically suspected LPNM was not confirmed in this study. Moreover, patients with age &#8805; 64 years and those with ypStage 0 may not receive benefit from ACT after nCRT followed by TME plus LLND. ",

        "AbstractText": "Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (PCC) is a malignant mass originating from the bile ducts. There is currently no unified treatment plan, and there are various treatment methods applied in clinical practice, as well as several different staging and typing systems to guide resectability, prognosis and survival prediction. The choice of treatment for PCC is closely related to the stage of the tumor. Accurate preoperative staging is necessary for correct resectability assessment and the selection of a reasonable treatment plan and surgical method; similarly, accurate postoperative pathological staging is necessary to guide further treatment and judgment of the patient's prognosis. A universally accepted staging system facilitates the comparison of cases between different centers, but there is much debate about the classification and staging of PCC. At present, the existing staging systems include the Bismuth-Corlette classification, AJCC/UICC TNM staging, modified T staging, Gazzaniga staging, JSBS staging, and Mayo staging. Each system has advantages, but there is no comprehensive guide for tumor resectability, prognosis, and survival. In this paper, the pros and cons of the different systems for staging PCC in terms of resectability, prognosis and survival prediction are discussed. ",

        "AbstractText": "Background: Researches on noncancer causes of death in patients with esophageal cancer (EC) are not in-depth. The objective of this paper is to broadly and deeply explore the causes of death in patients with EC, especially noncancer causes. Methods: Information about the demographics, tumor-related characteristics, and causes of death of patients with EC who met the inclusion criteria were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Calculated standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for all causes of death at different follow-up times and performed subgroup analyses. Results: In total, 63,560 patients with EC were retrieved from the public database. And 52,503 died during the follow-up period. Most deaths were due to EC itself within 5 years after diagnosis, but over 10 years, 59% EC patients died from noncancer causes. Cardiovascular disease was the major noncancer cause of death in patients with EC, accounting for 43%. Suicide and self-injury (2%) of EC patients should not be ignored. During the 1-year follow-up period, patients with EC had statistically highest risk of death from septicemia (SMR: 7.61; 95% CI: 6.38-9.00). Within more than 10 years after EC diagnosis, more and more patients died from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (SMR: 2.38; 95% CI: 1.79-3.10). Conclusions: Although most patients with EC still died from the cancer itself, the role of noncancer causes of death should not be underestimated. These prompt clinicians to pay more attention to the risk of death caused by these noncancer causes, which can provide relevant measures in advance to intervene. ",

Methods: This PMS was conducted as a multi-center, prospective, observational study at 34 centers in Korea from August 2013 to August 2019. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety of regorafenib in real-world practice, with the secondary objective to investigate its effectiveness, including its overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Results: In total, 301 patients were included in the analysis (254 patients with CRC, 14 patients with GIST, and 33 patients with HCC). The incidence rates of adverse events (AEs) were 85.0%, 78.6%, and 81.8% in patients with CRC, GIST, and HCC, respectively. The most frequent AE related to regorafenib in the three cancer types was palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES). The ORRs of patients with CRC, GIST, and HCC were 4.7%, 0%, and 41.4%, respectively. The median PFS and OS were 2.1 and 6.1 months for CRC, respectively; 9.2 and 16.4 months for GIST, respectively; and 5.5 months and not estimated (NE) for HCC, respectively. Patients who experienced a dose modification or discontinuation of regorafenib showed significantly shorter median PFS and OS (2.2 vs. 2.6 months, respectively, P = 0.0335 for PFS; 5.3 vs. 8.5 months, respectively, P = 0.0010 for OS). Conclusion: This PMS study, which is the largest surveillance study of CRC in Korea, found no newly identified safety concerns for patients who received regorafenib in the real-world setting.

Materials and methods: The data of NPC patients with secondary cancer were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database from 2004 to 2016. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors of secondary cancer. Risk factors selected from the multivariable logistic regression analysis were used to build a predicting model. Results: A total of 3931 patients were included: 329 (8.37%) patients developed secondary cancers and 3602 (91.63%) patients did not have secondary cancers. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age, race, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage were risk factors of secondary cancer. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that age [Odds ratio (OR) = 1.03, P < 0.001], race (OR = 1.17, P = 0.010), AJCC stage (OR = 0.82, P = 0.002), and chemotherapy (OR = 1.55, P = 0.028) were independent risk factors of secondary cancer. Age, race, AJCC stage, and chemotherapy were entered into a nomogram for predicting secondary cancer. The area under the ROC curve of the nomogram was 0.645 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.617-0.673]. The decision curve showed that if the threshold probability is between 4% and 25%, using the nomogram added more benefit than either the treat-all-patients scheme or the treat-none scheme.

Ergosterols are known for specific biological activities and have received widespread attention in cancer therapy. Here, LH-1, a kind of ergosterol from the secondary metabolites of the marine fungus Pestalotiopsis sp., was extracted, isolated, purified, and further investigated the biological activities against melanoma. In vitro experiments, the anti-proliferation effect on tumor cells was detected by MTT and colony formation assay, and the anti-metastatic effect on tumor cells was investigated by wound healing assay and transwell assay. Subcutaneous xenograft models, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry have been used to verify the anti-tumor, toxic, and side effect in vivo. Besides, the anti-tumor mechanism of LH-1 was studied by mRNA sequencing. In vitro, LH-1 could inhibit the proliferation and migration of melanoma cells A375 and B16-F10 in a dose-dependent manner and promote tumor cell apoptosis through the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. In vivo assays confirmed that LH-1 could suppress melanoma growth by inducing cell apoptosis and reducing cell proliferation, and it did not have any notable toxic effects on normal tissues. LH-1 may play an anti-melanoma role by upregulating OBSCN gene expression. These findings suggest that LH-1 may be a potential for the treatment of melanoma. ",

However, it is unclear whether gut microbiota is distinct between CRCs with different MMR status. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry for four major MMR proteins to determine the MMR status in 230 CRC patients. The gut microbiota was profiled in cancerous and adjacent normal tissues by using bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing. The differences in microbiota diversity, composition and related metabolic pathways between patients with dMMR and pMMR CRCs were explored. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis was further applied to validate the significant taxonomic differences at the genus level. In our study cohort, dMMR status was identified in 29 of 230 (12.61%) tumors. The richness (alpha-diversity) of gut microbiome in dMMR tumor tissue was higher compared with pMMR tumor tissues. The microbial community composition (beta-diversity) between the two groups was significantly different. The dMMR group was enriched considerably for some microbiota, including Fusobacteria, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia, and Actinobacteria at the phylum level and Fusobacterium, Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, Streptococcus, and Prevotella bacteria at the genus level. However, the pMMR group was dominated by Proteobacteria at the phylum level and Serratia, Cupriavidus and Sphingobium at the genus level. Moreover, a wide variety of microbiota associated functional pathways were observed with different MMR status. KEGG pathway analysis indicated a higher abundance of the biosynthesis and metabolic pathways of glycan and nucleotide, cell growth and death pathways, genetic replication and repair pathways in dMMR samples compared with the pMMR group. These findings demonstrate that CRC patients with different MMR status have distinct gut bacterial community richness, compositions and related metabolic pathways, suggesting basis that may explain the effectiveness of immunotherapy in dMMR tumors.

In this study, 16S rDNA sequencing was applied on 276 Thin-prep Cytologic Test (TCT) samples of patients from the Sanmenxia area. Systematical analysis of the microbiota structure, diversity, group, and functional differences between different HPV infection groups and age groups, and co-occurrence relationships of the microbiota was carried out. The major microbiota compositions of all patients include Lactobacillus iners, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Atopobium vaginae at species level, and Staphylococcus, Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, Bosea, Streptococcus, and Sneathia in genus level. Microbiota diversity was found significantly different between HPV-positive (Chao1 index: 98.8869, p < 0.01), unique-268 infected (infections with one of the HPV genotype 52, 56, or 58, 107.3885, p < 0.01), multi-268 infected (infections with two or more of HPV genotype 52, 56, and 58, 97.5337, p = 0.1012), other1 (94.9619, p < 0.05) groups and HPV-negative group (83.5299).

        "AbstractText": "Abdominal irradiation (IR) destroys the intestinal mucosal barrier, leading to severe intestinal infection. There is an urgent need to find safe and effective treatments to reduce IR-induced intestinal injury. In this study, we reported that metformin protected mice from abdominal IR-induced intestinal injury by improving the composition and diversity of intestinal flora. The elimination of intestinal microbiota (Abx) abrogated the protective effects of metformin on irradiated mice. We further characterized that treatment of metformin increased the murine intestinal abundance of Lactobacillus, which mediated the radioprotective effect. The administration of Lactobacillus or fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) into Abx mice considerably lessened IR-induced intestinal damage and restored the radioprotective function of metformin in Abx mice. In addition, applying the murine intestinal organoid model, we demonstrated that IR inhibited the formation of intestinal organoids, and metformin alone bore no protective effect on organoids after IR. However, a combination of metformin and Lactobacillus or Lactobacillus alone displayed a strong radioprotection on the organoid formation. We demonstrated that metformin/Lactobacillus activated the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling in intestinal epithelial cells and hence upregulated tight junction proteins and mucins in intestinal epithelia, increased the number of goblet cells, and augmented the mucus layer thickness to maintain the integrity of intestinal epithelial barrier, which eventually contributed to reduced radiation intestinal injury. In addition, we found that Lactobacillus abundance was significantly increased in the intestine of patients receiving metformin while undergoing abdominal radiotherapy and the abundance was negatively correlated with the diarrhea duration of patients. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that metformin possesses a protective effect on IR-induced intestinal injury by upregulating the abundance of Lactobacillus in the intestine. ",

Here, we investigated the impact of Akkermansia muciniphila-mediated post-antibiotic gut microbial reconstitution on the development of colitis-associated CRC (CAC). The results showed that post-antibiotic replenishment of A. muciniphila worsened the tumorigenesis of CAC as indicated by increased number of large (>2 mm in diameter) tumors and both average and total tumor diameters. Measures of intestinal barrier function showed that post-antibiotic A. muciniphila gavage damaged the intestinal barrier as reflected by lower transcriptional levels of Tjp1, Ocln, Cdh1, and MUC2. Impaired gut barrier was followed by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) translocation as indicated by higher level of serum LPS-binding protein (LBP). The increased colonic mRNA levels of Il1b, Il6, and Tnfa and serum levels of IL-1&#946;, IL-6, and TNF-&#945; indicated that post-antibiotic A. muciniphila replenishment resulted in overactivated inflammatory environment in CAC. The analysis of the evolution of the microbial community during the progression of CAC showed that post-antibiotic supplementation of A. muciniphila led to a distinct microbial configuration when compared with other treatments characterized by enriched Firmicutes, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae, and depleted Bacteroidetes, which was accompanied by higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio. Furthermore, post-antibiotic A. muciniphila administration changed the bile acid (BA) metabolic profile as indicated by decreased concentrations of secondary BA (SBA), &#969;-murocholic acid (&#969;MCA), and murocholic acid (muroCA). In addition, the A. muciniphila supplementation after antibiotic pretreatment also impacted the metabolism of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as evidenced by increased concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and valeric acid. Our study surprisingly observed that A. muciniphila-mediated post-antibiotic reconstitution of the gut microbiota aggravated the CAC in mice. It might exert its effect by damaging the gut barrier, exacerbating inflammatory responses, disrupting the post-antibiotic recovery of the microbial community, and further influencing the metabolism of BA and SCFAs. These findings indicated that maintaining the homeostasis of intestinal microorganisms is more crucial to health than replenishing a single beneficial microbe, and probiotics should be used with caution after antibiotic treatment.

We analysed the variations in 189 oncogenic signature gene sets between normal and tumourous tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and found that the \"CSR_LATE_UP\" signature was the most upregulated oncogenic signature gene set in bladder cancer. Next, we developed a common serum response (CSR) risk score (CRS) model based on fibroblast CSR genes and systematically analysed the correlations of these genes or the CRSs with survival, previously reported molecular subtypes, clinicopathological features, cancer signalling pathways, chemotherapeutic responses, and the tumour microenvironment using TCGA and validation cohorts. The CRS could predict the malignant phenotype, chemotherapeutic efficacy, immune invasion, and disease prognosis. Inflammatory signalling pathways (e.g., inflammatory response, TNFA signalling via NF&#408;B, IFN&#945; response, and IL2-STAT5 signalling) were markedly upregulated in patients with high CRS. Notably, the CSR-related gene ANLN was positively correlated with CD8+ immune cell infiltration, PD-L1 expression, and sensitivity to PD-L1 inhibitors and could thus provide guidance for clinical immunotherapy. This study highlights the crucial role of the CSR signature in bladder cancer and provides a CRS model for accurate predictions of the disease prognosis and chemotherapy and immunotherapy responses.

In the first two cohorts, age was associated with kynurenine (Kyn), quinolinic acid (QA), and the kynurenine to tryptophan ratio (KTR), and inversely with Trp. Consistent with these findings, Kyn, QA, and KTR increased over time, whereas Trp decreased. Similarly, QA and KTR were higher in community-dwelling older adults of age 74 compared to 71, whereas Trp was lower. Kyn and QA were more strongly correlated with age in the CSF compared to serum and increased in a subset of participants with repeated CSF sampling (n = 33) over four years. We assessed associations with frailty and mortality in two cohorts. QA and KTR were most strongly associated with mortality and frailty. Our study provides robust evidence of changes in tryptophan and kynurenine metabolism with human aging and supports links with adverse health outcomes. Our results suggest that aging activates the inflammation and stress-driven kynurenine pathway systemically and in the brain, but we cannot determine whether this activation is harmful or adaptive.

        "ArticleTitle": "High-dimensional Cost-constrained Regression via Nonconvex Optimization. ",
        "AbstractText": "Budget constraints become an important consideration in modern predictive modeling due to the high cost of collecting certain predictors. This motivates us to develop cost-constrained predictive modeling methods. In this paper, we study a new high-dimensional cost-constrained linear regression problem, that is, we aim to find the cost-constrained regression model with the smallest expected prediction error among all models satisfying a budget constraint. The non-convex budget constraint makes this problem NP-hard. In order to estimate the regression coefficient vector of the cost-constrained regression model, we propose a new discrete first-order continuous optimization method. In particular, our method delivers a series of estimates of the regression coefficient vector by solving a sequence of 0-1 knapsack problems. Theoretically, we prove that the series of the estimates generated by our iterative algorithm converge to a first-order stationary point, which can be a globally optimal solution under some conditions. Furthermore, we study some extensions of our method that can be used for general statistical learning problems and problems with groups of variables. Numerical studies using simulated datasets and a real dataset from a diabetes study indicate that our proposed method can solve problems of fairly high dimensions with promising performance.

        "AbstractText": "This study aimed to investigate the influencing factors of breast cancer recurrence by comparing the risk factors and lifestyle patterns related to breast cancer in Korean women with and without recurrence. This cross-sectional survey comprised 241 Korean women diagnosed with breast cancer who had received follow-up treatment. Participants were recruited from a university hospital in Seoul and an online social media platform for breast cancer patients. Data were collected either via online or a paper survey, using a structured questionnaire that included general and disease-related characteristics and lifestyle behaviors. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, univariate analysis, and logistic regression. Recurrence of breast cancer was influenced by four factors; childbirth experience, consumption of green/yellow vegetables, drinking behavior, and recovery from fatigue after sleep.Prevalence of recurrent breast cancer was associated with no childbirth experience (OR=2.29, p=.010), fewer green/yellow vegetables (OR=0.71, p=.008), drinking behavior (OR=0.24, p=.001), and a lower level of recovery from fatigue after sleep (OR=0.51, p<.001). Aside from having experienced childbirth, this study identified several modifiable factors that influence breast cancer recurrence. Increasing green/yellow vegetable intake, alleviating fatigue, and reducing alcohol intake are important. Intervention strategies in clinical research and practice can be applied to address risk factors and reduce the prevalence of recurrent breast cancer. ",

        "AbstractText": "Breast cancer (BC) has been a serious threat to women's health. Exosomes contain a variety of biomolecules, which is an excellent choice as disease diagnostic markers, but whether it could be applied as a noninvasive biomarker for BC diagnosis demands to be additional studied. In this study, we aimed at creating a predictive model and reveal the value of plasma exosomal miRNA (exo-miRNA) in early diagnosis of BC. Firstly, exosomes isolated from plasma were identified by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), and Western Blot. miRNA expression in plasma samples from 56&#8201;BC patients and 40 normal controls was analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. miRNAs with strong correlation characteristics were selected by Lasso logistic regression. Then, we built the training set and test set, evaluated the Lasso regression accuracy, and evaluated the performance of different models in the training set and test set. Finally, GO analysis, KEGG, and Reactome pathway enrichment analysis were used to understand the biological significance of 16 characteristic miRNAs. The successful separation of exosomes in serum was identified by NTA, TEM, and Western Blot. The training set data matrix containing 1962 miRNAs was obtained by sequencing for model construction, and 16 strongly correlated miRNAs were selected by Lasso logistic regression. The accuracy of Lasso regression in training set and test set were 97.22% and 95.83%, respectively. We built different models and evaluated the performance of each model in the training set and test set. The results showed that the AUC values of Lasso, SVM, GBDT, and Random Forest model in the training set were 1, and the AUC values in the test set were 0.979, 0.936, 0.971, and 0.979, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis showed that 16 signature miRNAs were significantly enriched in cancer-related pathways such as herpes simplex virus 1 infection, TGF-&#946; signaling, and Toll-like receptor family. The results of this study suggest that the 16 characteristic miRNAs screened from plasma exosomes can be used as a group of biomarkers, and the prediction model constructed based on this set of markers is expected to be used in the early diagnosis of BC.

        "AbstractText": "The abnormal growth of human healthy cells is called cancer. One of the major types of cancer is sarcoma, mostly found in human bones and soft tissue cells. It commonly occurs in children. According to a survey of the United States of America, there are more than 17,000 sarcoma patients registered each year which is 15% of all cancer cases. Recognition of cancer at its early stage saves many lives. The proposed study developed a framework for the early detection of human sarcoma cancer using deep learning Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) algorithms. The DNA of a human cell is made up of 25,000 to 30,000 genes. Each gene is represented by sequences of nucleotides. The nucleotides in a sequence of a driver gene can change which is termed as mutations. Some mutations can cause cancer. There are seven types of a gene whose mutation causes sarcoma cancer. The study uses the dataset which has been taken from more than 134 samples and includes 141 mutations in 8 driver genes. On these gene sequences RNN algorithms Long and Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units and Bi-directional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) are used for training. Rigorous testing techniques such as Self-consistency testing, independent set testing, 10-fold cross-validation test are applied for the validation of results. These validation techniques yield several metrics such as Area Under the Curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, Mathew's correlation coefficient, loss, and accuracy. The proposed algorithm exhibits an accuracy of 99.6% with an AUC value of 1.00. ",

        "AbstractText": "As a common cancer-related death worldwide, pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) has significantly increased mortality in recent years. In recent years, tumor mutation burden (TMB) has been regarded as the most popular biomarker for PAAD immunotherapy. However, it remains unclear which gene mutations affect TMB and immune response in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The somatic mutation images of PAAD samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). Based on the expression data of the TCGA and IGCC cohorts, various bioinformatics algorithms are used for evaluating the prognostic value and functional annotation of some frequently somatically mutated genes. Furthermore, the correlation between gene mutation and tumor immunity was also evaluated. The results showed that lysine methyltransferase 2C (KMT2C) and paternally expressed 3 (PEG3) are frequently mutated genes in PAAD. Patients with KMT2C and PEG3 mutations have higher TMB severity and a lousy prognosis. In addition, the mutations of KMT2C and PEG3 genes positively regulate the metabolic and protein-related pathways in PAAD. Meanwhile, significant differences in the composition of the immune cells were observed for KMT2C and PEG3 mutations PAAD patients, for providing additional guidelines for antitumor treatments in various KMT2C and PEG3 mutation states in PAAD. This study reveals that KMT2C and PEG3 mutation may serve as biomarkers for predicting prognosis and guiding anti-PAAD immunotherapy for PAAD patients. ",

        "AbstractText": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide. The identification of novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for CRC is a key research imperative. Immunohistochemical analysis has revealed high expression of centromere protein K (CENPK) in CRC. However, the role of CENPK in the progression of CRC is not well characterized. To evaluate the effects of knockdown of CENPK and overexpression of Cullin 4A (CUL4A) in RKO and HCT116 cells. Human colon cancer samples were collected and tested using a human gene expression chip. We identified CENPK as a potential oncogene for CRC based on bioinformatics analysis. In vitro experiments verified the function of this gene. We investigated the expression of CENPK in RKO and HCT116 cells using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), western blot, and flow cytometry. The effect of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) virus-infected RKO cells on tumor growth was evaluated in vivo using quantitative analysis of fluorescence imaging. To evaluate the effects of knockdown of CENPK and overexpression of CUL4A in RKO and HCT116 cells, we performed a series of in vitro experiments, using qPCR, western blot, MTT assay, and flow cytometry. We demonstrated overexpression of CENPK in human colon cancer samples. CENPK was an independent risk factor in patients with CRC. The downstream genes FBX32, CUL4A, and Yes-associated protein isoform 1 were examined to evaluate the regulatory action of CENPK in RKO cells. Significantly delayed xenograft tumor emergence, slower growth rate, and lower final tumor weight and volume were observed in the CENPK short hairpin RNA virus infected group compared with the CENPK negative control group. The CENPK gene interference inhibited the proliferation of RKO cells in vitro and in vivo. The lentivirus-mediated shRNA interference of CENPK inhibited the proliferation of RKO and HCT116 colon cancer cells, with overexpression of the CUL4A. We indicated a potential role of CENPK in promoting tumor proliferation, and it may be a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for CRC. ",

The independent sample t-test, Mann-Whitney U test or chi-squared test were used as appropriate for statistical analysis. After univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis, five independent factors were screened and incorporated to develop a calculator for predicting the risk of malignancy. Finally, the concordance index (C-index), calibration, area under the curve, decision curve analysis and clinical impact curves were used to evaluate the performance of the calculator.

Compared with the risk factors identified in the relevant guidelines, the current model showed better predictive performance and clinical utility. The calculator demonstrates optimal predictive performance for identifying the risk of malignancy, potentially yielding a personalized method for patient selection and decision-making in clinical practice.

However, the high rate of postoperative recurrence leads to a low five-year survival rate. In recent years, immunotherapy has received much attention. As the only immunotherapy drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) drugs have great potential in cancer therapy. Nevertheless, the efficacy of ICB treatment is greatly limited by the low immunogenicity and immunosuppressive microenvironment of GIC. Therefore, the targets of immunotherapy have expanded from ICB to increasing tumor immunogenicity, increasing the recruitment and maturation of immune cells and reducing the proportion of inhibitory immune cells, such as M2-like macrophages, regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Moreover, with the development of nanotechnology, a variety of nanoparticles have been approved by the FDA for clinical therapy, so novel nanodrug delivery systems have become a research focus for anticancer therapy.

        "AbstractText": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are the current guideline recommended treatment for many malignancies considered to be terminal. Despite considerable advances, their utility remains limited, and the field requires synergistic partners to further improve outcomes. Oncolytic viruses (OV) are emerging as contenders for the role of the synergistic agent of choice due to their multi-mechanistic effect on activating the tumor 'cold' immune microenvironment. Herpes simplex virus 1, a naturally selective OV, is the most advanced virotherapeutic compound in clinical applications for use in combination with ICI. We here present the case of a 72&#8201;year-old patient with a heavily pre-treated, advanced maxillary sinus squamous cell cancer with distant metastases who developed complete response (CR) with only three administrations of a programmed death 1 inhibitor after treatment interference by a severe herpes zoster infection, based on the related alpha-herpesvirus varicella zoster virus (VZV). This exceptional response has been followed and confirmed with imaging studies over more than 5&#8201;years. Although the patient had several favorable predictors for response to immunotherapy, we reason that the exceptional response may in part be secondary to the serendipitous VZV infection. Documented cases of cancer patients that achieved CR after few administrations of treatment with ICI are rare, with most reporting follow up of just over 1&#8201;year or less. In this case, it is conceivable that the interference of the infection with VZV, soon after the start of immunotherapy with ICI, led to a lasting antitumor immunity and sustained CR. This hypothesis is supported by the concept of 'oncolytic immunotherapy' which is reviewed in this manuscript. In addition, persistence of a TP53 mutation found in a liquid biopsy, despite clinical and radiologic remission, is discussed. ",

Phosphorylation of eNOS plays an important role in the synthesis of nitric oxide in endothelial cells, which is closely related to erectile dysfunction, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and other diseases. Our study aims to investigate the effect and mechanism of Icariside II on the rapid phosphorylation of eNOS. In this study, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were stimulated with Icariside II in the presence or absence of multiple inhibitors (1&#160;&#181;M), including LY294002 (PI3K-inhibitor), MK-2206 (AKT-inhibitor), Bisindolylmaleimide X (AMPK-inhibitor), H-89 (CaMKII-inhibitor), KN-62 (PKA-inhibitor), Dorsomorphin (PKC-inhibitor). The proliferation of HUVECs was assessed using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8). The release of nitric oxide (NO) within HUVECs was detected via fluorescence probe (DAF-FM). Western blot was used to examine the effect of Icariside II on the expression of eNOS, phosphorylation of eNOS, and common signaling pathways proteins. In this study, Icariside II was found to promote the cell proliferation and rapid NO release in HUVECs. The phosphorylation of eNOS-Ser1177 was significantly increased after Icariside II stimulation and reached a peak at 10 min (p&#160;<&#160;0.05). Meanwhile, the phosphorylation of eNOS-Thr495 was significantly decreased after 45 min of stimulation (p&#160;<&#160;0.05). Following the intervention with multiple inhibitors, it was found that MK-2206 (AKT inhibitor), LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor), KN-62 (AMPK inhibitor), and Bisindolylmaleimide X (PKC inhibitor) could significantly inhibit the phosphorylation of eNOS-Ser1177 caused by Icariside II (p&#160;<&#160;0.05), while MK-2206, LY294002, and Bisindolylmaleimide X reversed the alleviated phosphorylation of eNOS-Thr495. We concluded that Icariside can regulate rapid phosphorylation of eNOS- Ser1177 and eNOS-Thr495 via multiple signaling pathways, resulting in the up-regulation of eNOS and the increased release of NO.

        "AbstractText": "Herein, a versatile fluorescent bioanalysis platform for sensitive and specific screening of target miRNA (miR-129-2-3p) was innovatively designed by applying target-induced rolling circle amplification (RCA) for efficient signal amplification. Specifically, miR-129-2-3p was used as a ligation template to facilitate its ligation with padlock probes, followed by an RCA reaction in the presence of phi29 DNA polymerase. The dsDNA fragments and products were stained by SYBR Green I and then detected by fluorescence spectrophotometry. As a result, miR-129-2-3p concentrations as low as 50 nM could be detected. Furthermore, the expression of miR-129-2-3p in breast cancer patients was about twice that in healthy people. Therefore, the results indicated that the RCA-based biosensor system could be a valuable platform for miRNA detection in clinical diagnosis and biomedical study. ",

        "AbstractText": "This study aimed to establish a prognostic model related to prostate cancer (PCa) recurrence-free survival (RFS) and identify biomarkers. The RFS prognostic model and key genes associated with PCa were established using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Cox regression from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-PRAD and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) GSE46602 datasets. The weighted gene co-expression network (WGCNA) was used to analyze the obtained key modules and genes, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed. The phenotype and mechanism were verified in vitro. A total of 18 genes were obtained by LASSO regression, and an RFS model was established and verified (TCGA, AUC: 0.774; GSE70768, AUC: 0.759). Three key genes were obtained using multivariate Cox regression. WGCNA analysis obtained the blue module closely related to the Gleason score (cor = -0.22, P&#160;=&#160;3.3e&#160;-&#160;05) and the unique gene glutathione peroxidase 2 (GPX2). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the expression of GPX2 was significantly higher in patients with PCa than in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (P&#160;<&#160;0.05), but there was no significant correlation with the Gleason score (GSE46602 and GSE6919 verified), which was also verified in the GSE46602 and GSE6919 datasets. The GSEA results showed that GPX2 expression was mainly related to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and Wnt pathways. Additionally, GPX2 expression significantly correlated with eight kinds of immune cells. In human PCa cell lines LNCaP and 22RV1, si-GPX2 inhibited proliferation and invasion, and induced apoptosis when compared with si-NC. The protein expression of Wnt3a, glycogen synthase kinase 3&#946; (GSK3&#946;), phosphorylated (p)-GSK3&#946;, &#946;-catenin, p-&#946;-catenin, c-myc, cyclin D1, and vimentin decreased; the expression of E-cadherin increased; and the results for over-GPX2 were opposite to those for over-NC. The protein expression of GPX2 decreased, and &#946;-catenin was unchanged in the si-GPX2+ SKL2001 group compared with the si-NC group. We successfully constructed the PCa RFS prognostic model, obtained RFS-related biomarker GPX2, and found that GPX2 regulated PCa progression and triggered Wnt/&#946;-catenin/EMT pathway molecular changes.

        "AbstractText": "Methotrexate (MTX)&#160;is significantly more effective than and has a considerable advantage over placebo in patients with severe and persistent rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The drug is used to treat a variety of malignant disorders (leukemia&#160;and&#160;cancer of the lung, breast, and uterus) and ectopic pregnancy. As its side effects are outweighed by its effectiveness, MTX is a first-line antirheumatic drug in many countries. MTX is found in extracellular compartments, such as the synovium, as well as other organs, such as the kidney and liver. To improve treatment, increase adherence, and decrease mortality in MTX therapy, it is essential to reduce its toxicity and understand its side effects. Therefore, this comprehensive review was conducted to assist physicians and researchers in better understanding the toxicity of MTX and how to deal with this toxicity. MTX is eliminated via the kidneys, which are capable of excretion and reabsorption within the renal tubules. Although higher doses of MTX (known as high-dose MTX (HD-MTX), defined as doses of 500 mg/m2 or greater) are often more beneficial, they can produce toxicity and side effects such as bone marrow suppression, pulmonary toxicity, nephrotoxicity, hematologic toxicity, and an increased risk of infections.&#160;Treatment of severe MTX toxicity has three main goals: clearance of MTX from the bloodstream, folinic acid therapy, and organ treatment. Leucovorin is highly beneficial in preventing myelosuppression, gastric toxicity, and neurotoxic effects after HD-MTX therapy. The preferred antidote for MTX poisoning is folinic acid.&#160;Glucarpidase has been licensed for the treatment of high plasma MTX levels of >1 &#956;mol/L in patients with compromised renal function who have delayed MTX elimination. In patients with renal deficiency, a lower initial dose is considered with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 30 and 59 mL/minute. These patients need to be monitored, and a more gradual dosage increase&#160;and a lower weekly maximum should be considered regarding their general health situation. MTX is contraindicated in patients with RA if the eGFR is <30 mL/minute. ",

A relationship is known between low perceived social support (PSS) and depression. We aimed to investigate the relationships between alexithymia, PSS, and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score in patients diagnosed with early-stage BC. Materials and methods A demographic and medical information form, BDI, the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), and the Multidimensional Scale of PSS (MSPSS) were given to 200 early-stage BC patients to respond. Two subgroups were created as group A (BDI score < 17) and group B (BDI score &#8805; 17)&#160;and compared in terms of sociodemographic characteristics, TAS-20, and MSPSS scores. Results Twenty-six (18.1%), 48 (33.3%), and 26 (18.1%) patients were with high BDI scores, in low PSS status, and alexithymic, respectively. The median ages of the participants in group A and group B were 53.4 (interquartile range (IQR): 46-60.7) and 46&#160;(IQR: 41.5-59) years, respectively (p = 0.083). The rates of single participants (26.9% versus 11%, p = 0.055), alexithymic participants (42.3% versus 12.7%,&#160;p = 0.001), low PSS levels (57.7% versus 28%, p = 0.018), psychiatric treatment history (46.2% versus 22%, p = 0.025), and patients with low income (57.7% versus 22.9%, p = 0.001) were higher in group B than in group A. In the multivariate regression model that contains the parameters mentioned above, psychiatric treatment history (odds ratio (OR): 2.758, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.034-7.356, p = 0.043), low-income status (OR: 3.503, 95% CI: 1.336-9.182, p = 0.011), and alexithymia (OR: 3.482, 95% CI: 1.229-9.867, p = 0.019) were independent predictive factors for a high BDI. Conclusion Alexithymia and low PSS are significantly common in patients with prominent depressive symptoms in early-stage BC patients. Alexithymia may be associated with depression and may also have a role in depression pathogenesis in early-stage BC patients. New studies are needed to investigate whether there is a causal relationship between alexithymia and depression. ",

        "AbstractText": "This systematic review studies the relationship between vitamin D serum levels and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The primary source of vitamin D is sunlight exposure. Recently, an increase in the intake of vitamin D supplements has been noticed. The protective value of vitamin D is well established and has been studied several times for the health of the bones, cartilage, growth, various dermatological diseases, and also as a chemoprotective agent against several cancers. On the scientific front, it has yet to be established that increasing serum vitamin D levels increase the incidence of BCC. We included reports that investigated this relationship in this review. We applied keywords in published papers in PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane, and Google Scholar to find relevant studies. After applying the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist and the quality appraisal for 68 records, we included only ten studies. In these studies, serum levels of vitamin D were measured. Five of them supported the link between BCC incidence and development and high serum vitamin D levels (e.g., Mahamat-Saleh Y, et al.), while the other five did not (e.g., Tang JY, et al.). We included only two studies that investigated the vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphism. Experts debate adding a high dose of vitamin D supplements to our daily routine. After studying most of the reports, it was ascertained that the literature supports keeping vitamin D serum levels below 30-60 nmol/L. However, further studies should be done to help find a healthy balance of vitamin D serum levels, especially when it comes to increasing the risk of cancer like BCC. ",

T-lymphocytes target such cells for destruction, which include&#160;beta cells. Transplants of the pancreas, islets of Langerhans, and individual beta cells are all effective treatments for DM. Additionally, treating DM using stem cells is popular currently. The basis of stem cell therapy for DM is the replacement of beta cells, or dead pancreatic cells, with stem cells. After attaching to the tissues of the pancreas, the stem cells differentiate into active cells. An X-ray scanner is used to place a catheter into the pancreatic artery in DM, and the process lasts 90 minutes.

It affects one in 20 women globally and up to one in eight women in high-income countries. Cuproptosis is a copper-induced modality of mitochondrial cell death that is involved in tumor proliferation and metastasis. To construct a prognostic cuproptosis-related signature, LASSO Cox regression analysis was employed. Additionally, ceRNA was developed with an aim of exploring the possible lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory axis in breast cancer. The expression of FDX1, DLD, DLAT, LIAS, LIPT1, GLS MTF1, and PDHA1 was downregulated, while CDKN2A expression level was elevated in breast cancer in contrast with normal tissue. We furthermore reviewed the genetic mutation landscape of genes linked to cuproptosis in breast cancer. Prognosis analysis revealed poor OS and RFS rates in breast cancer patients with elevated levels of CDKN2A and PDHA1 and low levels of MTF1, DLD, LIPT1, and FDX1. We then constructed a cuproptosis-related signature with six genes (DKN2A, MTF1, PDHA1, DLD, LIPT1, and FDX1) for breast cancer, which predicted the OS rate with an accuracy that ranged from medium to high. Further analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between the cuproptosis-related prognostic signature and pTNM stage, MSI score, drug sensitivity, TMB score, and immune cell infiltration. Moreover, we identified the lncRNA XIST/miR-92b-3p/MTF1 regulatory axis for breast cancer.

By screening gastric cancer patients from 2010 to 2015 in the database of Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results, and collecting the clinicopathological and prognostic data of gastric cancer patients who underwent surgery from January 2014 to December 2016 in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, we analyzed the general pathological characteristics of GSRC by the chi-square test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to compare the factors affecting the survival and prognosis of early and advanced gastric adenocarcinoma. The Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted to reveal the survival difference between early and advanced GSRC and different differentiated types of gastric adenocarcinoma. The prognosis model of advanced GSRC was established with R software, and the area under curve (AUC) and C-index were used to assess the accuracy of the model. Analysis of pathological features revealed that signet ring-cell carcinoma (SRC) was more frequently seen in younger (< 60 years), female, and White patients compared to non-SRC patients. SRC was less commonly associated with early gastric cancer (EGC) (23.60% vs 39.10%), lower N0 (38.61% vs 61.03%), and larger tumour sizes > 5 cm (31.15% vs 27.10%) compared to the differentiated type, while the opposite was true compared to the undifferentiated type. Survival prognostic analysis found no significant difference in the prognosis of SRC patients among EGC patients. In contrast, among advanced gastric cancer (AGC) patients, the prognosis of SRC patients was correlated with age, race, tumour size, AJCC stage, T-stage, and postoperative adjuvant therapy. The predictive model showed that the 3-year AUC was 0.787, 5-year AUC was 0.806, and C-index was 0.766. Compared to non-SRC patients, patients with SRC had a better prognosis in EGC [hazard ratio (HR): 0.626, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.427-0.919, P < 0.05] and a worse prognosis in AGC (HR: 1.139, 95%CI: 1.030-1.258, P < 0.05). When non-SRC was divided into differentiated and undifferentiated types for comparison, it was found that in EGC, SRC had a better prognosis than differentiated and undifferentiated types, while there was no significant difference between differentiated and undifferentiated types. In AGC, there was no significant difference in prognosis between SRC and undifferentiated types, both of which were worse than differentiated types. A prognostic analysis of postoperative adjuvant therapy for SRC in patients with AGC revealed that adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy significantly improved patient survival (34.6% and 36.2% vs 18.6%, P < 0.05). The prognosis of SRC is better than that of undifferentiated type, especially in EGC, and its prognosis is even better than that of differentiated type. SRC patients can benefit from early detection, surgical resection, and aggressive adjuvant therapy. ",

By contrast, diagnosing and treating other common malignant tumors (such as lung and gastrointestinal cancer) offers multiple strategies for chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy with the prospect of a cure. With various specialists involved in clinical multiple disciplinary team (MDT) discussion, personal bias can be minimized. It can also ignite important discussion which can benefit not only one patient but many patients. Here, we report on the MDT diagnosis and management of the malignant splenic tumors littoral cell angiosarcoma and histiocytic sarcoma. Although only two cases of rare primary splenic malignancy are presented, MDT is a novel means of rare disease treatment. To benefit patients, imaging analysis, safe operation, precise pathology examination, and individualized therapeutic treatment strategies are required. The involvement of various specialists in a clinical MDT discussion minimizes personal bias and can create important ideas to benefit all patients. ",

The incidence of ICI-associated arthritis (IA) is unknown. In most cases, IA is not serious and non-lethal. Higher checkpoint inhibitor arthritis disease activity may be associated with cancer progression. Here, we report a severe case of IA with high arthritis disease activity in advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma, causing permanent withdrawal of pembrolizumab, but the patient remained in complete remission (CR) 20 mo after the development of IA. An 81-year-old smoking man was admitted to our hospital because of left chest pain for 9 mo. He was finally diagnosed with advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma, with programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 expression of 70%. The patient responded to pembrolizumab treatment and achieved CR, but IA occurred after the 5th cycle of pembrolizumab administration. Although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were prescribed, arthralgia and joint swelling occurred. The symptoms of arthritis were further aggravated when immunotherapy was given again after short-term withdrawal. Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score, a traditional measure of arthritis activity, was 43. Intravenous methylprednisolone was prescribed at 20 mg/d and then tapered over the subsequent 4 wk. The symptoms of arthritis steadily improved and completely resolved 4 mo after withdrawal of pembrolizumab. A recent follow-up in June 2022 revealed satisfactory clinical recovery of arthritis and the patient remained in CR. This case report highlights that early recognition of IA and appropriate treatment are critical to improving the outcome of both ICI-arthritis and lung cancer. ",

SMARCA4 expression has been associated with poor prognosis in various types of cancer; however, the specific mechanism of action of SMARCA4 in HCC needs to be fully elucidated. To explore the specific mechanism of action of SMARCA4 in HCC. Herein, the expression level of SMARCA4 as well as its association with HCC prognosis were evaluated using transcriptome profiling and clinical data of 18 different types of cancer collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Furthermore, SMARCA4-high and -low groups were identified. Thereafter, gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses were performed to identify the function of SMARCA4, followed by construction of a SMARCA4-specific competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network using starBase database. The role of SMARCA4 in immunotherapy and its association with immune cells were assessed using correlation analysis. It was observed that SMARCA4 was overexpressed and negatively correlated with prognosis in HCC. Further, SMARCA4 expression was positively associated with tumor mutational burden, microsatellite stability, and immunotherapy efficacy. The SNHG3/THUMP3-AS1-miR-139-5p-SMARCA4 ceRNA network was established and could be assumed to serve as a stimulatory mechanism in HCC. The findings of this study demonstrated that SMARCA4 plays a significant role in progression and immune infiltration in HCC. Moreover, a ceRNA network was detected, which was found to be correlated with poor prognosis in HCC. The findings of this study could contribute towards the identification of predictive markers for immunotherapy and a novel mechanism of action for HCC treatment. ",

The combination of MPN and thalassemia is extremely unusual. Several cases with myeloproliferative neoplasms and &#946;-thalassemia have been reported. However, these have not been extensively reviewed. The present report describes two cases of myeloproliferative neoplasms complicated with &#946;-thalassemia and reviews all similar cases reported in the literature. We report two patients who were diagnosed with myeloproliferative neoplasms complicated with &#946;-thalassemia. Both patients had abnormal increases in platelet counts. Based on bone marrow pathology and molecular biology assessment, we made the diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasms complicated with &#946;-thalassemia. The female patient was given hydroxyurea and interferon, which enabled good control of her blood counts; the male patient was given ruxolitinib tablets, thalidomide tablets, and interferon to control the condition, but the patient poorly responded to drug treatment and died of gastrointestinal bleeding six months later. Given the findings of our cases and the literature review, we hypothesize that myeloproliferative neoplasms complicated with &#946;-thalassemia can lead to rapid disease progression and a poor prognosis.

He then underwent exploratory laparotomy and a left lateral hepatectomy was performed. The patient recovered with an uneventful postoperative course and PCT level decreased gradually and was normal on day 16.

        "AbstractText": "Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) is a cytosolic methyltransferase, catalyzing N-methylation of nicotinamide (NAM) to form 1-methylnicotinamide (1-MNAM), in which S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) is the methyl donor. It has been well documented that NNMT is elevated in multiple cancers and promotes tumor aggressiveness. In the present study, we investigated the effects of NNMT overexpression on cellular metabolism and proinflammatory responses. We found that NNMT overexpression reduced NAD+ and SAM levels, and activated the STAT3 signaling pathway. Consequently, STAT3 activation upregulated interleukin 1&#946; (IL1&#946;) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), leading to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) accumulation. On the other hand, NNMT downregulated 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) which catalyzes PGE2 into inactive molecules. Moreover, secretomic data indicated that NNMT promoted secretion of collagens, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and extracellular matrix proteins, confirming NNMT aggravated inflammatory responses to promote cell growth, migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and chemoresistance. Taken together, we showed that NNMT played a pro-inflammatory role in cancer cells by activating the STAT3/IL1&#946;/PGE2 axis and proposed that NNMT was a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment.

        "AbstractText": "Antimicrobial resistance is a global health threat that is exacerbated by the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in medicine and agriculture. As an alternative to conventional antimicrobial drugs, phage therapy involves the treatment of infected patients with a bacteriophage that naturally destroys bacterial pathogens. With the re-emergence of phage therapy, novel tools are needed to study phages. In this work we set out to screen and isolate peptide candidates that bind to phages and act as affinity tags. Such peptides functionalized with an imaging agent could serves as versatile tools for tracking and imaging of phages. Specifically, we screened a phage display library for peptides that bind to the Good Vibes phage (GV), which lyses the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Isolated monoclonal library phages featured a highly conserved consensus motif, LPPIXRX. The corresponding peptide WDLPPIGRLSGN was synthesized with a GGGSK linker and conjugated to cyanine 5 or biotin. The specific binding of the LPPIXRX motif to GV in vitro was confirmed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We demonstrated imaging and tracking of GV in bacterial populations using the fluorescent targeting peptide and flow cytometry. In conclusion, we developed fluorescent labeled peptides that can bind to bacteriophage GV specifically, which may enable real-time analysis of phage in vivo and monitor the efficacy of phage therapy.

        "AbstractText": "Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and exosomes, both released from the primary tumor into peripheral blood, are a promising source of cancer biomarkers. They are detectable in the blood and carry a large diversity of biological molecules, which can be used for the diagnosis and monitoring of minimally invasive cancers. However, due to their intrinsic differences in counts, size, and molecular contents, studies have focused on only one type of vesicle. Herein, we have developed an integrated system to sequentially isolate CTCs and exosomes from a single patient blood sample for further profiling and analysis. The CTCs are isolated using a commercial filtration method and then the remaining blood is processed using multiple cycles of ultracentrifugation to isolate the exosomes. The method uses two available technologies where the eluent from CTC isolation is usually discarded and interfaces them, so that the eluent can be interfaced to exosome isolation methods. The CTCs are identified based on fluorescence staining of their surface markers, while the exosomes are analyzed using transmission electron microscopy, nanosight tracking analysis, and mass spec proteomic analysis. This analysis showed CTCs detected by their surface markers for metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), while essentially none were detected for cirrhosis. The exosome analysis resulted in the identification of &#8764;500-1000 exosome proteins per sample confirmed by detection of exosome surface markers CD9, CD63, CD81, and TSG101 in addition to proteins related to cancer progression. Proteins enriched in HCC exosomes were shown to be involved in the immune response, metastasis, and proliferation. ",

Although it is highly heterogeneous at genetic levels, BBS10 is one of the major causative genes worldwide. The BBS10 protein is part of a multiprotein complex localized at the basal body of the primary cilium. With the advancement of sequencing technologies, novel missense mutations are regularly reported in BBS10. However, prioritizing missense variants and conducting further in-depth analysis are key challenges in addressing their pathogenic effect. This study aims to characterize the known missense mutations of BBS10 by combining nine different in silico tools (SIFT, SNAP2, PROVEAN, Align-GVGD, ConSurf, I Mutant, MuPro, PremPS, and Dynamut) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. A total of 101 BBS10 missense variants have been analyzed. Our results showed that six BBS10 missense variants (Ser191Leu, Cys19Gly, Ile342Thr, Cys371Ser, Ala417Glu, and Tyr613Cys) were potentially deleterious.

However, specialized equipment used in clinical laboratories often comes with trade-offs between operation and function serving a single role for very specific needs. For example, to achieve high analytical sensitivity and specificity, instruments such as high-performance liquid chromatography and/or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry use a complex instrument design and require thorough training of the users. On the other hand, simple tests such as protein detection in urinary tract infection using dip-stick assays provide very quick results but suffer from poor analytical sensitivity. Here, we present an application study for the 3D particle counter technology, which is based on optical confocal detection in order to scan large sample volumes (0.5-3 mL) in glass cuvettes, that aims to close the gap between analytical sensitivity and turnover assay time and simplify protein detection by adopting bead-based immunoassays. Combining the 3D particle counter technology with bead-based immunoassays, a subpicomolar limit of detection-ranging from 119 to 346 fM-was achieved within 3.5-hour assay time for recombinant mouse interleukin 6 detection. As an alternative instrument to a flow cytometer, the 3D particle counter takes advantages of bead-based immunoassays and provides unique accessibility and flexibility for users. ",

        "AbstractText": "Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are recognized as one of the most beneficial tools for biomedicine, especially in theranostic applications. Even though SPIONs have excellent properties regarding their biocompatibility and unique magnetic properties, they lack stability in biological fluids. To stabilize and increase the specificity of the SPIONs to target desirable cells or tissues, several surface coatings have been introduced. These surface coatings can lead to different preferences of serum protein bindings, which ultimately determine their behaviors in vitro and in vivo. Thus, understanding the interaction of SPIONs with biological systems is important for their biocompatible design and clinical applications. In this study, using proteomic analyses, we analyzed the protein corona fingerprints on SPIONs with two different coatings, including citrate and riboflavin, that have been widely used as surface coatings and ligands for enhancing cellular uptake in breast cancer cells. Though both citrate-coated SPIONs (C-SPIONs) and riboflavin-coated SPIONs (Rf-SPIONs) showed similar sizes and zeta potentials, we found that Rf-SPIONs adsorbed more serum proteins than bare SPIONs (B-SPIONs) or C-SPIONs, which was likely due to the higher hydrophobicity of the riboflavin. The enriched proteins consisted mainly of immune-responsive and blood coagulation proteins with different fingerprint profiles. Cellular uptake studies in MCF-7 breast cancer cells comparing the activities of preformed and in situ coronas showed different uptake behaviors, suggesting the role of protein corona formation in promoting the interaction between the SPIONs and the cells. The results obtained here provide the essential information for further development of the potential strategy to reduce or stimulate immune response in vivo to increase therapeutic applications of both C-SPIONs and Rf-SPIONs.

This pharmacovigilance analysis aimed to comprehensively investigate the frequency, spectrum, timing, and outcomes of cardiovascular toxicities associated with angiogenesis inhibitors and to explore the differences in such patterns between mAbs and TKIs. Disproportionality analysis was performed by leveraging reports from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from 2014 to 2021. Cardiovascular adverse events (AEs) were grouped into nine narrow categories using the Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Queries (SMQs). Reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information components (ICs) were calculated with statistical shrinkage transformation formulas and a lower limit of 95% confidence interval (CI) for ROR (ROR025) > 1 or IC (IC025) > 0, with at least three reports being considered statistically significant. A total of 757,577 reports of angiogenesis inhibitors and 70,668 (9.3%) reports of cardiovascular AEs were extracted. Significant disproportionality was detected in angiogenesis inhibitors for cardiovascular AEs (IC025/ROR025 = 0.35/1.27). Bevacizumab (31.8%), a mAb, presented the largest number of reports, followed by sunitinib (12.4%), a TKI.

Due to the involvement of the hemostatic system in cancer patients, some of its biomarkers, such as fibrinogen, could be a useful tool in predicting cancer risk. We performed a case-cohort study to evaluate the relationship among fibrinogen levels and colorectal cancer (CRC). In the framework of Moli-sani Study (N = 24,325, enrolled 2005-2010) a subcohort of 1,290 individuals (55.0% women; mean age 55.0 &#177; 12.0 years) was selected and compared with 126 CRC cases identified during a follow-up of 4.3 years. Incident cases of colorectal cancer were ascertained by direct linkage with hospital discharge forms according to the International Classification of Disease (ICD-9-CM) codes: 153-154. Events were validated through medical records and confirmed by histological reports. Fibrinogen levels were measured in frozen citrated plasma samples. Hazard Ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), adjusted by relevant covariates were estimated by a Cox regression model using Prentice method. Individuals with levels of fibrinogen &#8805;400 mg/dL had a higher hazard to develop colorectal cancer when compared to those with lower levels after adjustment for sex and age (HR: 1.81; 95% CI 1.12-2.92). Additional adjustment for CRC family history, income, physical activity, diabetes medication and hypercholesterolemia did not modify the result (HR: 1.91; 95% CI 1.15-3.17).

Sensitivity analyses confirmed the main findings, showing independence from a potential role of confounding by a large panel of biomarkers, including inflammation and hemostasis factors. Our results, based on a case-cohort study from a general adult population apparently free from any cancer during the recruitment, showed that fibrinogen levels &#8805;400 mg/dL were positively and independently associated with CRC, suggesting that this glycoprotein could be a potential biomarker for this type of cancer and supporting the \"common soil hypothesis\" in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease and tumors.

Therefore, our purpose was to: (1) identify sarcoma patients at the highest risk of fatal HD compared with the general population, (2) identify patients and sarcoma characteristics associated with a higher risk of HD death, and (3) determine if chemotherapy increased the risk of HD death in sarcoma patients. From 1975 to 2016, we identified patients diagnosed with bone and soft tissue sarcoma from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database in the US. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were evaluated using mortality data from the general population collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. This was the largest retrospective cohort study of fatal HD in individuals with sarcoma. In 80,905 sarcoma patients observed for 530,290 person-years, 3,350 deaths from HD were identified with a mortality of 631.7/100,000 person-years. The SMR of death from HD was 1.38 (95% CI: 1.33-1.42). The highest risks of death from HD were observed in patients with Ewing sarcoma (SMR = 5.44; 95% CI: 3.38-8.75) and osteosarcoma (SMR = 1.92; 95% CI: 1.55-2.38). Patients diagnosed at < 19 years old had the highest SMR in all age subgroups, and a higher risk of fatal HD relative to the general population was observed in sarcoma survivors diagnosed at < 85 years old. In patients diagnosed at < 19 years old, HD plurality occurred in those with Ewing sarcoma (29.4%) and osteosarcoma (32.4%) and at > 35 years old, HD plurality occurred in those diagnosed with liposarcoma (19.0%) and malignant fibro histiocytoma (MFH) (23.6%). For sarcoma survivors, HD mortality risks were highest within the first year after diagnosis (SMR = 1.31; 95% CI: 1.21-1.41), and this risk remained elevated throughout follow-up compared with the general population. Subgroup analyses indicated that chemotherapy significantly increased the risk of fatal HD in patients with localized osteosarcoma (Hazard ratio (HR) = 3.18; 95% CI: 1.24-8.13; P = 0.016), but not in patients with other histological sarcoma subtypes and clinical stages. The risk of death from HD mainly varied in patients with different histological sarcoma subtypes and clinical stages.

Cases were divided into a neutrophil infiltration group and a no-neutrophil group based on the presence or absence of histopathologically identified neutrophilic infiltrates. Among the 26 patients, histopathological examination identified active myocarditis in four patients. All patients with myocarditis exhibited extensive accompanying neutrophil infiltration, and all patients without myocarditis did not. The neutrophil infiltration group exhibited significantly higher rates of detection of interleukin-6 (100 vs. 4.6%) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (100 vs. 31.8%) than the no-neutrophil group (both p < 0.05). On admission, four patients with neutrophil infiltration in myocardium had significantly higher baseline levels of aspartate aminotransferase, D dimer, and high-sensitivity C reactive protein than the other 22 patients (all p < 0.05).

The study population included 23,797 participants (mean age 58 years; 63% women) from the Malm&#246; Diet and Cancer Study cohort. Participants were enrolled between 1991 and 1996 and followed until end of 2016 (median follow-up 21.5 years). Incident aIS events were identified using national registries (total cases 1,937). Measures of PA (total, leisure-time, occupational, and domestic) were assessed using a baseline questionnaire and dietary intakes were estimated using a modified diet history method. Overall diet quality was assessed using a diet quality index. Intake of key food groups and beverages associated with overall diet quality were investigated separately. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using multivariable Cox regression models adjusting for confounders. A high diet quality with high intake of fruit and vegetables, fish and shellfish and low intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and red and processed meat compared to a low diet quality was associated with lower risk of aIS (HR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.69-0.97; p = 0.015). Leisure-time PA was associated with reduced risk of aIS (HR = 0.95 per SD increase in MET-hours/week, 95% CI = 0.91-0.99; p = 0.028) with null associations observed for total, occupational and domestic PA level. We observed no significant interaction between diet and PA on the risk of aIS. The standardized 20-year risk of aIS among subjects with low leisure-time PA and low diet quality was 8.1% compared to 6.1% among those with high leisure-time PA and high diet quality. Several components of a healthy diet and being physically active may reduce the risk of aIS, however, the absolute risk reduction observed was modest. A high diet quality seemed to have a risk reducing effect regardless of level of PA suggesting that individuals with a sedentary lifestyle may still gain some positive health benefits through a healthy diet.

        "AbstractText": "To compare the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs combined with antiangiogenic agents between non-small cell lung cancer patients with exon 19 deletion and patients with exon 21 Leu858 Arg mutation. Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were systematically searched for studies published until March 2022. Randomized control trials comparing the survival of EGFR-TKIs plus antiangiogenic agents with EGFR-TKI were extracted. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Five randomized control trials involving 1533 patients were as follows: 818 patients had exon 19 deletion, and 715 patients with exon 21 Leu858 Arg mutation. The methodological quality of the 5 randomized control trials was high. EGFR-TKIs plus antiangiogenic agents improved PFS in patients with exon 19 deletion (hazard ratio [HR]&#8201;=&#8201;0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51-0.75) and exon 21 Leu858 Arg mutation (HR&#8201;=&#8201;0.61, 95% CI: 0.50-0.75). PFS did not differ between the exon 19 deletion and exon 21 Leu858 Arg mutation groups (Z&#8201;=&#8201;0.07, P=0.94). PFS was comparable between patients receiving EGFR-TKIs combined with antiangiogenic agents with exon 19 deletion and those with exon 21 Leu858 Arg mutation. ",

        "ArticleTitle": "A randomized controlled trial of a coping-focused family resilience intervention program for breast cancer patients: Study protocol. ",
        "AbstractText": "Breast cancer patients and their families are under various pressures in the process of disease diagnosis and treatment, which seriously threaten their physical and mental health. Findings from existing research suggest that good family resilience can help breast cancer families better adapt and cope with adversity and challenges. However, there are only a few intervention studies on family resilience and no intervention studies on resilience among the families of breast cancer patients. Therefore, this study aims to explore appropriate measures to improve the resilience level of breast cancer families and help them better cope with the disease. The purpose of this study protocol is to demonstrate a coping-focused family resilience intervention to increase the level of resilience in the families of breast cancer patients and help them better cope with adversity. The trial will recruit 80 breast cancer families and randomly assign them to experimental and control groups in a 1:1 ratio. The control group will receive routine care, and the intervention group will receive a 6-week one-on-one online family resilience intervention based on the control group. Two groups of subjects will be assessed at baseline and at 1&#8201;week, 1&#8201;month, and 3&#8201;months after the intervention. The primary outcome is family resilience, and the secondary outcomes are coping style, social support, family disease burden, and levels of anxiety and depression. We hypothesized that after the intervention, the intervention group would have significantly higher levels of family resilience than the preintervention and control groups. In the intervention group, other aspects related to family resilience, such as family disease burden and anxiety and depression levels of patients and their families, were significantly alleviated, and disease coping and social support levels were improved accordingly. If the program works, it can help breast cancer families identify family strengths and resources to proactively address challenges so that families can successfully navigate the crisis and patient and family recovery can be facilitated. It can also provide a practical path for clinical workers to help breast cancer families adjust rationally.

        "AbstractText": "Lifestyle factors are known to be influential determinants of health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately one third of deaths involve unhealthy lifestyle habits. Among lifestyle risk factors for head and neck cancers (HNC), alcohol consumption and smoking have an undeniable role in the multifactorial aetiology of the disease. In recent years, the promotion of healthy lifestyle choices has gained significant attention as contributory to improving health and disease prevention. Interventions to tackle these risk factors are vitally important in disease prevention and progression. However, in order to effectively prevent the disease and reduce the risk factors, it is crucial to identify what upstream reasons lead to the adoption of these lifestyle risk factors in the first place. Stress being a constant aspect of modern-day life is known to contribute to alcohol and smoking practices. In this review paper, relevant literature was searched in PubMed database for stress, lifestyle factors, HNC and cancer to explore the role of stress and its associated biological pathways as an upstream factor in the adoption of lifestyle risk factors that cause HNC. It highlights the importance of stress pathways and the Hypothalamus Pituitary Adrenal (HPA) axis as a locus of interaction between stress, alcohol, smoking and cancer. Despite their widely accepted harmful effects, alcohol and smoking remain deeply rooted in contemporary life. A greater understanding of the impact of stress on lifestyle choices and an exploration of the mechanisms resulting in stress, alcohol- and smoking- related cancer may highlight opportunities for improved prevention measures through the modification of unhealthy lifestyle choices.

However, little research is available on the relationships between social support, body image, and overall psychological health outcomes in breast cancer (BC) patients. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of depressive symptoms and post-traumatic growth (PTG) and examine the mediating roles of social support between body image and depressive symptoms and PTG among BC patients, respectively. A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Northeast China from December 2015 to August 2017. All the participants were diagnosed with BC and underwent surgery. This study was conducted with 405 BC patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University. Participants completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, Post Traumatic Growth Inventory, Body Image Scale, and Perceived Social Support Scale. The associations of social support, body image with depressive symptoms, and PTG were examined by hierarchical linear regression analysis. Asymptotic and resampling strategies were used to explore the mediating role of social support. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 88.1%, and 67.2% of the patients had moderate-high PTG, 52.84% of the patients had body concerns, and 264 (65.19%) patients had high-level social support. Body image was positively associated with depressive symptoms (&#946; = 0.445, P < 0.001) and social support was negatively associated with depressive symptoms (&#946; = -0.219, P < 0.001). Body image was negatively associated with PTG (&#946; = -0.095, P = 0.023), whereas social support was positively associated with PTG (&#946; = 0.533, P < 0.001). Social support significantly mediated the associations among body image, depressive symptoms (effect size = 0.057), and PTG (effect size = -0.304), respectively. Social support played mediating role in the relationships between body image and depressive symptoms and PTG. The interventions based on social support and body image should be included in psychological health prevention. ",

A 15-year-old male, a known case of type I neurofibromatosis (NF1), referred to our hospital with a complaint of right upper quadrant pain. He had a caf&#233;-au-lait spot and positive family history of NF1 in his mother. Laboratory data was within normal limits, and computed tomography (CT) revealed a large predominantly less attenuated infiltrative liver mass along the porta hepatis with extension to both lobes of the liver. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large hypo-signal mass in T1-weighted images and hypersignal lesion in T2-sequences with faint enhancement, periportal distribution, and encasing of major branches of the portal vein without evidence of narrowing and invasion. A CT-guided biopsy was taken from both liver lobe lesions, and pathological diagnosis of the biopsy specimens confirmed plexiform neurofibromas of the liver. According to the extensive intrahepatic extension and periportal infiltration, the mass was unrespectable.

        "AbstractText": "The current study aimed to investigate sequence variations in the C-terminus of latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) isolates from Iranian patients with chronic gastritis or gastric cancer (GC). LMP1, an essential viral oncoprotein, is the critical element in the immortalization of B cells. It contains a small twenty-four amino acid cytoplasmic N-terminal region, six transmembrane segments, and a two hundred amino acid cytoplasmic C-terminal domain. Most LMP1-mediated signal transduction events are moderated by some functional parts of the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain. Thirty-two EBV-positive biopsy tissues were obtained from patients with gastric cancer and patients with chronic gastritis. The C-terminal nucleotide sequences of LMP1 were amplified using nested-PCR and analyzed by DNA sequencing. Four to eight copies of the 11 repeat elements (codon 254-302) were observed in the carboxyl-terminal site of patients, but no relationship was found between the number of repeat sequences and disease status. The 30-bp deletion corresponding to codon 345-354 of the B95-8 strain was observed in 34% of isolates, and the remaining samples were non-deleted. In the gastric cancer group, a higher number of 33-bp repeats (&#8805;5 repeats) was observed in 30-bp-deletion (100%) than in non-deleted (42%) isolates, and the difference was statistically significant. Analysis revealed that a gastritis isolate may be the result of recombination between Alaskan and China1 strains. Overall, the current results showed no association between C-terminal sequence variations of LMP1 and malignant or non-malignant isolate origin. ",

The most common form of esophageal cancer is esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). While, miRNAs are well recognized as having a critical regulatory role in human cancer, their responsibilities and mechanisms of miRNA-mRNA in ESCC are unknown. Differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and mRNAs (DEmRNAs) were identified using the LIMMA package in R. In total, 478 DEmRNA (224 upregulated and 254 downregulated) and 39 DEmiRNA (15 upregulated and 24 downregulated) were screened. The RNAInter database analyzed miRNA-mRNA interactions; then, the miRNA-mRNA network was visualized by Cytoscape software. ClusterProfiler packages were used to perform gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses for DEmRNA as targets of DEmiRNAs. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that the p53 signaling pathway, ECM-receptor interaction, and AGE-RAGE signaling pathway were significant. Cellular response to amino acid stimulus, negative regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway, and endoderm formation were most prevalent in the biological process category. Additionally, the collagen-containing extracellular matrix, actomyosin complex collagen trimers, basement membrane, and extracellular matrix structural constituent were more enriched. Overall, the present survey provides evidence that could support the prognosis of esophageal tumors in the future. ",

        "AbstractText": "Although osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in children, its location in the axial skeleton is rare, particularly at the cervical spine. Early diagnosis, together with multidisciplinary management, improves survival rates. Safe resection and stable reconstruction are complicated by the particular anatomy of the cervical spine, which raises the risks. A 12-year-old male patient presented with cervical pain for several months and a recent weight loss of 3&#8197;kg. The complementary workup revealed a large destructive bone lesion in C7 with vertebral body collapse, subluxation, partial involvement of C6 and T1, large associated anteroposterior soft tissue components, and spinal canal narrowing. A biopsy suggested giant cell-rich osteosarcoma (GCRO). After 10 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgical resection was performed through a double approach: anterior, for tumoral mass resection from C6-7 vertebral bodies and reconstruction placing a mesh cage filled with iliac crest allograft plus anterior plate fixation; and posterior, for C7 complete and C6 partial posterior arch resection, thus completing a total piecemeal spondylectomy preserving the dura intact, added to a C5-T3 posterior fusion with screws and transitional rods. Postoperative chemo and radiotherapy were administered. Clinical and radiological follow-up showed disease-free survival and no neurological involvement at 3 years. An extensive review of the literature did not find any published cases of GCRO of the cervical spine in pediatric patients. This can be explained by the combination of three peculiar conditions: its location at the cervical spine region, the young age, and the GCRO variant. ",

        "AbstractText": "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the leading histological subtype of lung cancer worldwide, causing high mortality each year. The tumor immune cell infiltration (ICI) is closely associated with clinical outcome with LUAD patients. The present study was designed to construct a gene signature based on the ICI of LUAD to predict prognosis. Downloaded the raw data of three cohorts of the TCGA-LUAD, GSE72094, and GSE68465 and treat them as training cohort, validation cohort one, and validation cohort two for this research. Unsupervised clustering detailed grouped LUAD cases of the training cohort based on the ICI profile. The univariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier was adopted to identify potential prognostic genes from the differentially expressed genes recognized from the ICI clusters. A risk score-based prognostic signature was subsequently developed using LASSO-penalized Cox regression analysis. The Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox analysis, ROC, IAUC, and IBS were constructed to assess the ability to predict the prognosis and effects of clinical variables in another two independent validation cohorts. More innovatively, we searched similar papers in the most recent year and made comprehensive comparisons with ours. GSEA was used to discover the related signaling pathway. The immune relevant signature correlation identification and immune infiltrating analysis were used to evaluate the potential role of the signature for immunotherapy and recognize the critical immune cell that can influence the signature's prognosis capability. A signature composed of thirteen gene including ABCC2, CCR2, CERS4, CMAHP, DENND1C, ECT2, FKBP4, GJB3, GNG7, KRT6A, PCDH7, PLK1, and VEGFC, was identified as significantly associated with the prognosis in LUAD patients. The thirteen-gene signature exhibited independence in evaluating the prognosis of LUAD patients in our training and validation cohorts. Compared to our predecessors, our model has an advantage in predictive power. Nine well know immunotherapy targets, including TBX2, TNF, CTLA4, HAVCR2, GZMB, CD8A, PRF1, GZMA, and PDCD1 were recognized correlating with our signature. The mast cells were found to play vital parts in backing on the thirteen-gene signature's outcome predictive capacity. Collectively, the current study indicated a robust thirteen-gene signature that can accurately predict LUAD prognosis, which is superior to our predecessors in predictive ability. The immune relevant signatures, TBX2, TNF, CTLA4, HAVCR2, GZMB, CD8A, PRF1, GZMA, PDCD1, and mast cells infiltrating were found closely correlate with the thirteen-gene signature's power. ",

        "AbstractText": "The cell surface proteome (\"surfaceome\") serves as the interface between diseased cells and their local microenvironment. In cancer, this compartment is critical not only for defining tumor biology but also serves as a rich source of potential therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers. Recently, we profiled the surfaceome of the blood cancer multiple myeloma, an incurable plasma cell malignancy. While available small molecule agents can drive initial remissions in myeloma, resistance inevitably occurs. Several new classes of immunotherapies targeting myeloma surface antigens, including antibody therapeutics and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells, can further prolong survival. However, new approaches are still needed for those who relapse. We thus applied the glycoprotein cell surface capture (CSC) methodology to panel of multiple myeloma cell lines, identifying key surface protein features of malignant plasma cells. We characterized the most abundant surface proteins on plasma cells, nominating CD48 as a high-density antigen favorable for a possible avidity-based strategy to enhance CAR-T efficacy. After chronic resistance to proteasome inhibitors, a first-line therapy, we found significant alterations in the surface profile of myeloma cells, including down-regulation of CD50, CD361/EVI2B, and CD53, while resistance to another first-line therapy, lenalidomide, drove increases in CD33 and CD45/PTPRC. In contrast, short-term treatment with lenalidomide led to upregulation of the surface antigen MUC-1, thereby enhancing efficacy of MUC-1 targeting CAR-T cells. Integrating our proteomics data with available transcriptome datasets, we developed a scoring system to rank potential standalone immunotherapy targets. Novel targets of interest included CCR10, TXNDC11, and LILRB4. We developed proof-of-principle CAR-T cells versus CCR10 using its natural ligand, CCL27, as an antigen recognition domain. Finally, we developed a \"miniaturized\" version of the CSC methodology and applied it to primary myeloma patient specimens. Overall, our work creates a unique resource for the myeloma community. This study also supports unbiased surface proteomic profiling as a fruitful strategy for identifying new therapeutic targets and markers of drug resistance, that could have utility in improving myeloma patient outcomes. Similar approaches could be readily applied to additional tumor types or even models/tissues derived from other diseases. ",

        "AbstractText": "Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, and cisplatin-based chemotherapy is the main treatment for NSCLC. However, cisplatin resistance of NSCLC cells is a major challenge for NSCLC treatment. qRT-PCR and Western blot were performed to detect the expression of LINC02389 and miR-7-5p in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry assay were applied to exam cell proliferation and apoptosis rate of NSCLC cells. The interaction between LINC02389 and miR-7-5p was verified by dual luciferase reporter gene assay, RNA pull-down assay, and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. Additionally, cisplatin-resistant NSCLC cells were generated to assess the biological function of LINC02389 and miR-7-5p in cisplatin resistance of NSCLC. LINC02389 was highly expressed in NSCLC tissues and was correlated with poor prognosis of NSCLC patients. Knockdown of LINC02389 inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis of NSCLC, whereas miR-7-5p knockdown exerted the opposite effects. Moreover, LINC02389 negatively regulated the expression of miR-7-5p. In addition, LINC02389 was overexpressed, yet miR-7-5p was downregulated in cisplatin-resistant NSCLC cells compared with their parental cells. Moreover, oxidative stress biomarkers were overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant cells and were regulated by LINC02389. Besides, LINC02389 could reverse the inhibitory effect of cisplatin on NSCLC cells, which was partially reversed by attenuating the expression of miR-7-5p. Our research firstly demonstrated that lncRNA LINC02389 acted as an oncogene to promote progression, oxidative stress, and cisplatin resistance through sponging miR-7-5p and may provide therapeutic targets for NSCLC.

        "AbstractText": "Bio-orthogonal bond-cleavage reactions have been used in cancer therapy for improving the biological specificity of prodrug activation, but the spatiotemporal consistency of reactants is still a huge challenge. Although, in most cases, the cleavage catalysts and caged prodrugs are administrated separately, it is difficult to avoid the reactions in advance before they meet at the tumor site. Herein, we design and construct novel coordinative nanoparticles, integrating two prodrugs A and B as ligands and ferric ions as coordinative centers. After nanoparticles accumulated in tumor through passive targeting, inert Pt(IV) prodrug A is specifically and spontaneously reduced into active Pt(II) cisplatin, which acts as the cleavage catalyst to subsequently initiate the in situ bio-orthogonal depropargylation of B, that is, O 2-propargyl nitric oxide (NO) donor. The unique structure of coordinative nanoparticles ensures the spatiotemporal consistency of reactants (prodrugs A and B) and products (cytotoxic cisplatin and tumoricidal NO) for the bio-orthogonal bond-cleavage reaction, which leads to an improved synergistic therapeutic activity for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). This new concept of bio-orthogonal dual-prodrug coordinative nanoparticles may inspire further applications in bio-orthogonal chemistry and drug delivery for combination chemotherapy. ",

Herein, we report on our institution's provider experience after the mature adoption of telemedicine. We distributed a survey to all radiation oncology attending physicians at our institution in October 2021 to assess satisfaction, facilitators, and barriers to telemedicine implementation. We performed quantitative and qualitative analyses to characterize satisfaction and identify influencing factors whether telemedicine is employed. We calculated the average proportion of visits that providers expected to be appropriately performed with telemedicine for each disease site and visit type. A total of 60 of the 82 eligible radiation oncologists (73%) responded to the survey, of whom 78% were satisfied with telemedicine in the radiation oncology department and 83% wished to continue offering video visits after the COVID-19 public health emergency ends. Common patient factors influencing whether physicians offer telemedicine include the patient's travel burden, patient preferences, and whether a physical examination is required. Approximately 20% of new consultations and 50% of weekly management visits were estimated to be appropriate for telemedicine. The central nervous system/pediatrics and thoracic faculty considered telemedicine appropriate for the greatest proportion of new consultations, and 93% of respondents felt comfortable determining whether telemedicine was appropriate. Surveyed radiation oncologists were satisfied with telemedicine in their practice, and wished to continue offering video visits in the future.

Therefore, these models are more appropriate for cancer drug screening. We have recently developed a protocol for MCF-7 cell spheroid culture, and used this method to test the effects of different types of drugs on this estrogen-dependent breast cancer cell spheroid. Our results demonstrated that MCF-7 cells can grow spheroid in medium using a low attachment plate. We managed to grow one spheroid in each well, and the spheroid can grow over a month, the size of the spheroid can grow over a hundred times in volume. Our targeted drug experimental results suggest that estrogen sulfotransferase, steroid sulfatase, and G protein-coupled estrogen receptor may play critical roles in MCF-7 cell spheroid growth, while estrogen receptors &#945; and &#946; may not play an essential role in MCF-7 spheroid growth. Organoids are the miniatures of in vivo tissues and reiterate the in vivo microenvironment of a specific organ, best fit for the in vitro studies of diseases and drug development. Tumoroid, developed from cancer cell lines or patients' tumor tissue, is the best in vitro model of in vivo tumors. 3D spheroid technology will be the best future method for drug development of cancers and other diseases. Our reported method can be developed clinically to develop personalized drugs when the patient's tumor tissues are used to develop a spheroid culture for drug screening. ",

Uterine lavage combined with TP53 ultra-deep sequencing for the detection of disseminated OC cells has emerged as a promising tool, but this approach has not been tested for early-stage disease or non-serous histologies. In addition, lavages carry multiple background mutations, the significance of which is poorly understood. Uterine lavage was collected preoperatively in 34 patients undergoing surgery for suspected ovarian malignancy including 14 patients with benign disease and 20 patients with OC (6 non-serous and 14 high grade serous-like (serous)). Ultra-deep duplex sequencing (~3000x) with a panel of common OC genes identified the tumor mutation in 33% of non-serous (all early stage) and in 79% of serous cancers (including four early stage). In addition, all lavages carried multiple somatic mutations (average of 25 mutations per lavage), more than half of which corresponded to common cancer driver mutations. Driver mutations in KRAS, PIK3CA, PTEN, PPP2R1A and ARID1A presented as larger clones than non-driver mutations and with similar frequency in lavages from patients with and without OC, indicating prevalent somatic evolution in all patients. Driver TP53 mutations, however, presented as significantly larger clones and with higher frequency in lavages from individuals with OC, suggesting that TP53-specific clonal expansions are linked to ovarian cancer development. Our results demonstrate that lavages capture cancer cells, even from early-stage cancers, as well as other clonal expansions and support further exploration of TP53 mutation burden as a potential OC risk factor.

In this approach, the immunogen and cytokine are co-anchored to alum particles via a short phosphoserine (pSer) peptide linker, promoting stable binding to alum and sustained bioavailability following injection. pSer-modified eOD and IL-21&#160;promote enhanced lymphatic drainage and lead to accumulation of the vaccine in B cell follicles in the draining lymph nodes. This in turn promotes enhanced T follicular helper cell priming and robust germinal center responses as well as increased antigen-specific serum IgG titers.

The mechanisms that mediate a mutualistic relationship between tumor cells and macrophages remain poorly characterized. Here, we have shown in vitro that different human and murine cancer cell lines release branched-chain &#945;-ketoacids (BCKAs) into the extracellular milieu, which influence macrophage polarization in an monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1)-dependent manner. We found that &#945;-ketoisocaproate (KIC) and &#945;-keto-&#946;-methylvalerate (KMV) induced a pro-tumoral macrophage state, whereas &#945;-ketoisovalerate (KIV) exerted a pro-inflammatory effect on macrophages. This process was further investigated by a combined metabolomics/proteomics platform.

Proteomic and pathway analyses revealed that the three BCKAs, especially KMV, exhibited divergent effects on the inflammatory signal pathways, phagocytosis, apoptosis and redox balance.

        "AbstractText": "Despite the fact that the new drugs and targeted therapies have been approved for cancer therapy during the past 30 years, the majority of cancer types are still remain challenging to be treated. Due to the tumor heterogeneity, immune system evasion and the complex interaction between the tumor microenvironment and immune cells, the great majority of malignancies need multimodal therapy. Unfortunately, tumors frequently develop treatment resistance, so it is important to have a variety of therapeutic choices available for the treatment of neoplastic diseases. Immunotherapy has lately shown clinical responses in malignancies with unfavorable outcomes. Oncolytic virus (OV) immunotherapy is a cancer treatment strategy that employs naturally occurring or genetically-modified viruses that multiply preferentially within cancer cells. OVs have the ability to not only induce oncolysis but also activate cells of the immune system, which in turn activates innate and adaptive anticancer responses. Despite the fact that OVs were translated into clinical trials, with T-VECs receiving FDA approval for melanoma, their use in fighting cancer faced some challenges, including off-target side effects, immune system clearance, non-specific uptake, and intratumoral spread of OVs in solid tumors. Although various strategies have been used to overcome the challenges, these strategies have not provided promising outcomes in monotherapy with OVs. In this situation, it is increasingly common to use rational combinations of immunotherapies to improve patient benefit. With the development of other aspects of cancer immunotherapy strategies, combinational therapy has been proposed to improve the anti-tumor activities of OVs. In this regard, OVs were combined with other biotherapeutic platforms, including various forms of antibodies, nanobodies, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, and dendritic cells, to reduce the side effects of OVs and enhance their efficacy. This article reviews the promising outcomes of OVs in cancer therapy, the challenges OVs face and solutions, and their combination with other biotherapeutic agents. ",

        "AbstractText": "The extracellular matrix (ECM)&#160;is a vital component of the tumor microenvironment, which interplays with stromal and tumor cells to stimulate the capacity of cancer cells to proliferate, migrate, invade, and undergo angiogenesis. Nevertheless, the crucial functions of ECM-related genes (ECMGs) in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) have not been systematically evaluated. Hence, a comprehensive evaluation of the ECMGs is required in pan-cancer, especially in PAAD. First, a pan-cancer overview of ECMGs was explored through the integration of expression profiles, prognostic values, mutation information, methylation levels, and pathway-regulation relationships. Seven ECMGs (i.e. LAMB3, LAMA3, ITGB6, ITGB4, ITGA2, LAMC2, and COL11A1) were identified to be hub genes of PAAD, which were obviously up-regulated in PAAD and considerably linked to tumor stage as well as prognosis. Subsequently, patients with PAAD were divided into 3 clusters premised on ECMG expression and ECM scores. Cluster 2 was the subtype with the best prognosis accompanied by the lowest ECM scores, further verifying ECM's significant contribution to the pathophysiological processes of PAAD. Significant differences were observed for oncogene and tumor suppressor gene expression, immune microenvironment, and chemotherapy sensitivity across three ECM subtypes. After applying a variety of bioinformatics methods, a novel and robust ECM-associated mRNA-lncRNA-based prognostic panel (ECM-APP) was developed and validated for accurately predicting clinical outcomes of patients with PAAD. Patients with PAAD were randomly categorized into the train, internal validation, and external validation cohorts; meanwhile, each patient was allocated into high-risk (unfavorable prognosis) and low-risk (favorable prognosis) populations premised on the expression traits of ECM-related mRNAs and lncRNAs. The discrepancy in the tumor mutation burden and immune microenvironment might be responsible for the difference in prognoses across the high-risk and low-risk populations. Overall, our findings identified and validated seven ECMGs remarkably linked to the onset and progression of PAAD. ECM-based molecular classification and prognostic panel aid in the prognostic assessment and personalized intervention of patients with PAAD. ",

The present study aimed to thoroughly evaluate the effect of KIRs and binding ligands assessed by various models, in addition to other patient/donor variables, on clinical outcomes in haplo-HSCT. In a cohort of 354 patients undergoing their first haplo-HSCT, we found that a higher Count Functional inhibitory KIR score (CF-iKIR) was associated with improved progression-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; P = .029) and overall survival (OS) (HR, 0.66; P = .016), while none of the other models predicted for survival in these patients. Moreover, using exploratory classification and regression tree analysis, we found that donor age <58 years combined with cytomegalovirus-nonreactive recipient was associated with the best OS, whereas donor age >58 years was associated with the worst OS. In the rest of our cohort (80%), cytomegalovirus-reactive recipients with a donor <58 years old, a higher CF-iKIR was associated with superior OS.

Until now, the functions and mechanisms of METTL24 in KIRC have remained mostly unknown. The mRNA expression of METTL24 in KIRC was analyzed using the TIMER 2.0, GEPIA, and UALCAN databases. The immunohistochemical assay was performed to validate METTL24 expression in our self-built Chinese cohort (n tumor = 88, n normal = 85). The gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to investigate the biological processes in which METTL24 might be engaged. The Spearman analysis was used to evaluate the expression correlations between METTL24 and a range of immunological variables, and the effects of METTL24 on the infiltration levels of multiple immune cells were explored using TCGA data. The upstream transcription factors of METTL24 were screened through a multi-omics analysis. METTL24 expression in KIRC tissues was significantly decreased compared to normal adjacent kidney tissues, which was associated with the lower survival rate of KIRC patients. METTL24 potentially participated in the immune-relevant biological processes such as cytokine binding, NF-kappa B binding, MHC protein complex, and interleukin-12 action. Besides, METTL24 expression was linked to a number of immune checkpoints, cytokines, chemokines, and chemokine receptors, and also correlated with the infiltration levels of 10 types of immune cells in KIRC. Meanwhile, METTL24 expression differently affected the overall survival rates (OS) of KIRC patients with high or low levels of immune infiltration. Finally, CTCF and EP300 were discovered to be the probable transcription factors of METTL24 in KIRC. This study revealed that METTL24 might serve as a prognostic marker in KIRC and as one immune-relevant target for clinical treatment. ",

        "AbstractText": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a single-strand RNA mosquito-borne flavivirus with significant public health impact. ZIKV infection induces double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) in human neural progenitor cells that may contribute to severe neuronal manifestations in newborns. The DNA-PK complex plays a critical role in repairing DSBs and in the innate immune response to infection. It is unknown, however, whether DNA-PK regulates ZIKV infection. Here we investigated the role of DNA-PKcs, the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK, during ZIKV infection. We demonstrate that DNA-PKcs restricts the spread of ZIKV infection in human epithelial cells. Increased ZIKV replication and spread in DNA-PKcs deficient cells is related to a notable decrease in transcription of type I and III interferons as well as IFIT1, IFIT2, and IL6. This was shown to be independent of IRF1, IRF3, or p65, canonical transcription factors necessary for activation of both type I and III interferon promoters. The mechanism of DNA-PKcs to restrict ZIKV infection is independent of DSB. Thus, these data suggest a non-canonical role for DNA-PK during Zika virus infection, acting downstream of IFNs transcription factors for an efficient antiviral immune response. ",

        "AbstractText": "Cancer immunotherapy is an increasingly successful strategy for treating patients with advanced or conventionally drug-resistant cancers. T cells have been proved to play important roles in anti-tumor and tumor microenvironment shaping, while these roles have not been explained in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). In this study, we first performed a comprehensive analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database to identify 72 T-cell marker genes. Subsequently, we constructed a 5-gene prognostic signature in the training cohort based on the T-cell marker genes from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database, which was further validated in the testing cohort and GEO cohort. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve at 1-, 3-, and 5-years were 0.614, 0.713 and 0.702 in the training cohort, 0.669, 0.603 and 0.645 in the testing cohort, 0.661, 0.628 and 0.590 in the GEO cohort, respectively. Furthermore, we created a highly reliable nomogram to facilitate clinical application. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that immune-related pathways were mainly enriched in the high-risk group. Tumor immune microenvironment indicated that high-risk group exhibited higher immune score, stromal score, and immune cell infiltration levels. Moreover, genes of the immune checkpoints and human leukocyte antigen family were all overexpressed in high-risk group. Drug sensitivity revealed that low-risk group was sensitive to 8 chemotherapeutic drugs and high-risk group to 4 chemotherapeutic drugs. In short, our study reveals a novel prognostic signature based on T-cell marker genes, which provides a new target and theoretical support for LUSC patients. ",

        "ArticleTitle": "Metabolic requirements of Th17 cells and of B cells: Regulation and defects in health and in inflammatory diseases. ",
        "AbstractText": "The immune system protects from infections and cancer through complex cellular networks. For this purpose, immune cells require well-developed mechanisms of energy generation. However, the immune system itself can also cause diseases when defective regulation results in the emergence of autoreactive lymphocytes. Recent studies provide insights into how differential patterns of immune cell responses are associated with selective metabolic pathways. This review will examine the changing metabolic requirements of Th17 cells and of B cells at different stages of their development and activation. Both cells provide protection but can also mediate diseases through the production of autoantibodies and the production of proinflammatory mediators. In health, B cells produce antibodies and cytokines and present antigens to T cells to mount specific immunity. Th17 cells, on the other hand, provide protection against extra cellular pathogens at mucosal surfaces but can also drive chronic inflammation. The latter cells can also promote the differentiation of B cells to plasma cells to produce more autoantibodies. Metabolism-regulated checkpoints at different stages of their development ensure the that self-reactive B cells clones and needless production of interleukin (IL-)17 are limited. The metabolic regulation of the two cell types has some similarities, e.g. the utility of hypoxia induced factor (HIF)1&#945; during low oxygen tension, to prevent autoimmunity and regulate inflammation. There are also clear differences, as Th17 cells only are vulnerable to the lack of certain amino acids. B cells, unlike Th17 cells, are also dependent of mechanistic target of rapamycin 2 (mTORC2) to function. Significant knowledge has recently been gained, particularly on Th17 cells, on how metabolism regulates these cells through influencing their epigenome. Metabolic dysregulation of Th17 cells and B cells can lead to chronic inflammation. Disease associated alterations in the genome can, in addition, cause dysregulation to metabolism and, thereby, result in epigenetic alterations in these cells. Recent studies highlight how pathology can result from the cooperation between the two cell types but only few have so far addressed the key metabolic alterations in such settings. Knowledge of the impact of metabolic dysfunction on chronic inflammation and pathology can reveal novel therapeutic targets to treat such diseases. ",

As infiltrating immune cells in tumor microenvironment (TME) played a key role in tumor progression and responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, we want to construct an immune-related scoring system with detailed immune profiles to stratify CRC patients. We developed a scoring system based on immune-related signatures and validated its ability to predict prognosis and immunotherapeutic outcomes in CRC. CD45+ cells from CRC patients were sorted to investigate detailed immune profiles of the stratification system using mass cytometry. A single-cell RNA sequencing dataset was used to analyze transcriptomic profiles. We constructed an immune-related signature score (IRScore) based on 54 recurrence-free survival (RFS)-related immune signatures to stratify CRC patients. We revealed that IRScore was positively correlated with RFS and favorable outcomes in ICB treatment. Moreover, we depicted a detailed immune profile in TME using mass cytometry and identified that CD103+CD39+ T cells, characterized by an exhaustive, cytotoxic and proliferative phenotype, were enriched in CRC patients with high IRScore. As a beneficial immune signature, CD103+CD39+ T cells could predict prognosis and responses to ICB therapy in CRC. All the analyses above revealed that IRScore could be a valuable tool for predicting prognosis and facilitating the development of new therapeutic strategies in CRC, and CD103+CD39+ T cells were one of defined immune signatures in IRScore, which might be a key factor for antitumor immunity.

IMiDs have shown remarkable therapeutic efficacy in a set of B-cell neoplasms including multiple myeloma, B-cell lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. More recently, the advent of immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of these B-cell neoplasms. However, the success of immunotherapy is restrained by immunosuppressive signals and dysfunctional immune cells in the TME. Due to the pleiotropic immunobiological properties, IMiDs have shown to generate synergetic effects in preclinical models when combined with monoclonal antibodies, immune checkpoint inhibitors or CAR-T cell therapy, some of which were successfully translated to the clinic and lead to improved responses for both first-line and relapsed/refractory settings.

        "AbstractText": "The liver has been proposed as an important \"immune organ\" of the body, as it is critically involved in a variety of specific and unique immune tasks. It contains a huge resident immune cell repertoire, which determines the balance between tolerance and inflammation in the hepatic microenvironment. Liver-resident immune cells, populating the sinusoids and the space of Disse, include professional antigen-presenting cells, myeloid cells, as well as innate and adaptive lymphoid cell populations. Machine perfusion (MP) has emerged as an innovative technology to preserve organs ex vivo while testing for organ quality and function prior to transplantation. As for the liver, hypothermic and normothermic MP techniques have successfully been implemented in clinically routine, especially for the use of marginal donor livers. Although there is evidence that ischemia reperfusion injury-associated inflammation is reduced in machine-perfused livers, little is known whether MP impacts the quantity, activation state and function of the hepatic immune-cell repertoire, and how this affects the inflammatory milieu during MP. At this point, it remains even speculative if liver-resident immune cells primarily exert a pro-inflammatory and hence destructive effect on machine-perfused organs, or in part may be essential to induce liver regeneration and counteract liver damage. This review discusses the role of hepatic immune cell subtypes during inflammatory conditions and ischemia reperfusion injury in the context of liver transplantation. We further highlight the possible impact of MP on the modification of the immune cell repertoire and its potential for future applications and immune modulation of the liver. ",

        "AbstractText": "The tumor immune microenvironment could provide prognostic and predictive information. It is necessary to develop a noninvasive radiomics-based biomarker of a previously validated tumor immune microenvironment signature of gastric cancer (GC) with immunohistochemistry staining. A total of 230 patients (training (n = 153) or validation (n = 77) cohort) with gastric cancer were subjected to (Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography) radiomics feature extraction (80 features). A radiomics tumor immune microenvironment score (RTIMS) was developed to predict the tumor immune microenvironment signature with LASSO logistic regression. Furthermore, we evaluated its relation with prognosis and chemotherapy benefits. A 8-feature radiomics signature was established and validated (area under the curve=0.692 and 0.713). The RTIMS signature was significantly associated with disease-free survival and overall survival both in the training and validation cohort (all P<0.001). RTIMS was an independent prognostic factor in the Multivariate analysis. Further analysis revealed that high RTIMS patients benefitted from adjuvant chemotherapy (for DFS, stage II: HR 0.208(95% CI 0.061-0.711), p=0.012; stage III: HR 0.321(0.180-0.570), p<0.001, respectively); while there were no benefits from chemotherapy in a low RTIMS patients. This PET/CT radiomics model provided a promising way to assess the tumor immune microenvironment and to predict clinical outcomes and chemotherapy response. The RTIMS signature could be useful in estimating tumor immune microenvironment and predicting survival and chemotherapy benefit for patients with gastric cancer, when validated by further prospective randomized trials.

However, there were some patients with prolonged TTS(> 6 weeks). This study aimed to explore whether prolonged TTS (> 6 weeks) would affect the outcomes. Patients diagnosed with locally advanced ESCC between January 2020 and March 2022 and undergoing esophagectomy following nICT were identified based on a prospectively collected database. Primary outcome measures were pathological complete response (pCR) and disease-free survival (DFS), and the secondary outcomes were 30-day postoperative mortality and morbidity, surgical time, postoperative hospital stay, and hospital expense. Total of 95 patients were included for analysis, with 52 patients in the standard TTS group and 43 patients in the prolonged TTS group. The clinical and demographic characteristics of the two groups were comparable. The prolonged group had a median 18 days longer TTS(P<0.001). The pCR rate was 23.08% (12/52) in the standard group and 16.28% (7/43) in the prolonged group (P=0.41). Multivariate regression analysis further indicated that TTS wasn't an independent factor in predicting pCR (P=0.41). The median follow-up time was 10.5 months in the standard TTS group and 11.2 months in the prolonged TTS group. A total of five recurrences occurred with two events in the standard TTS group and three events in the prolonged TTS group, and no significant difference was observed in DFS(P=0.60). Both groups were comparable in postoperative hospital stays, total hospital stay, hospital expenses, and comprehensive complications index (CCI).

In this study, an aGC cohort (Kim cohort, RNAseq, N=45) treated by ICIs, and 467 aGC patients from seven cohorts were conducted to investigate the value of the APscore predicting the prognosis and response to ICIs. Subsequently, the associations of the APscore with the tumor microenvironment (TME), molecular characteristics, clinical features, and somatic mutation variants in aGC were assessed. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the APscore was analyzed to estimate response to ICIs. Cox regression or Log-rank test was used to estimate the prognosis of aGC patients. The APscore constructed by principal component analysis algorithms was an effective predictive biomarker of the response to ICIs in the Kim cohort and 467 aGC patients (Kim: AUC =0.85, 95% CI: 0.69-1.00; 467 aGC: AUC =0.69, 95% CI: 0.63-0.74).

Next, we evaluated the value of several central genes in predicting the prognosis and response to ICIs in aGC patients, and verified them using immunogenic, transcriptomic, genomic, and multi-omics methods. Lastly, a predictive model built successfully discriminated patients with vs. without immunotherapy response and predicted the survival of aGC patients.

We conducted a longitudinal analysis of antibodies, T cells, and monocytes in 25 participants vaccinated with mRNA or ChAdOx1-S up to 12 weeks after the 3rd (booster) dose with mRNA vaccine. We observed a substantial increase in antibodies and CD8 T cells specific for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 after vaccination. Moreover, vaccination induced activated T cells expressing CD69, CD137 and producing IFN-&#947; and TNF-&#945;. Virus-specific CD8 T cells showed predominantly memory phenotype. Although the level of antibodies and frequency of virus-specific T cells reduced 4-6 months after the 2nd dose, they were augmented after the 3rd dose followed by a decrease later. Importantly, T cells generated after the 3rd vaccination were also reactive against Omicron variant, indicated by a similar level of IFN-&#947; production after stimulation with Omicron peptides. Breakthrough infection in participants vaccinated with two doses induced more SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells than the booster vaccination. We found an upregulation of PD-L1 expression on monocytes but no accumulation of myeloid cells with MDSC-like immunosuppressive phenotype after the vaccination.

CXCR6 is a marker for resident memory T (TRM) cells that plays a role in immunosurveillance through their interaction with epithelial cells. The interaction of CXCR6 with CXCL16 expressed at the membrane of certain subpopulations of intratumor dendritic cells (DC) called DC3, ideally positions these CXCR6+ T cells to receive a proliferation signal from IL-15 also presented by DC3. Mice deficient in cxcr6 or blocking the interaction of CXCR6 with its ligand, experience a poorer control of tumor proliferation by CD8+ T cells, but also by NKT cells especially in the liver. Intranasal vaccination induces CXCL16 production in the lungs and is associated with infiltration by TRM expressing CXCR6, which are then required for the efficacy of anti-tumor vaccination. Therapeutically, the addition of CXCR6 to specific CAR-T cells enhances their intratumoral accumulation and prolongs survival in animal models of pancreatic, ovarian and lung cancer. Finally, CXCR6 is part of immunological signatures that predict response to immunotherapy based on anti-PD-(L)1 in various cancers.

Immune-responsive gene 1 (IRG1) decarboxylates cis-aconitate to produce itaconate in the mitochondria. Itaconate serves as an immunomodulator of macrophages and represses inflammation in infectious diseases. Recently, a study showed that an itaconate derivative inhibits neuroinflammation and reduces chronic pain in mice. However, the function and molecular mechanisms of endogenous itaconate in neuropathic pain have not been fullyelucidated. In this study, the content of itaconate in the ipsilateral spinal cord after nerve-injured mice was detected with mass spectrometry. The Irg1-/- mouse was constructed to determine the role of endogenous itaconate in the chronic constriction nerve injury (CCI) model. The analgesic effect of exogenous itaconate was assessed with intraperitoneal and intrathecal administration in both male and female CCI mice. The spinal application of 4-OI also reduced the evoked responses of wide dynamic range neurons in CCI mice. The potential analgesic mechanism of itaconate was explored through molecular biology experiments and verified in Interleukin (IL)-10-/- mice. We found the levels of itaconate and IRG1 in the spinal cord significantly increased after CCI. Irg1 deficiency aggravated the mechanical and heat hypersensitivity, while the exogenous administration of the itaconate derivative 4-OI alleviated the neuropathic pain in male and female CCI mice. Mechanistically, the treatment of 4-OI increased the level of IL-10 and activates STAT3/&#946;-endorphin pathway in the spinal cord, and the analgesia effect of itaconate was impaired in IL-10-/- mice. Finally, we showed that the upregulation of IL-10 induced by 4-OI was mainly from spinal neurons through Nrf2 pathway. This study demonstrated the analgesic effect of endogenous and exogenous itaconate in the neuropathic pain model, suggesting that the spinal IL-10/STAT3/&#946;-endorphin pathway might mediate the analgesia effect of itaconate.

We used collagenase digested trephine biopsies to directly quantify MSCs in 73 patients before (n = 18) and/or after alloHCT (n = 65). For the first time, we demonstrate that acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD, n = 39) is associated with a significant decrease in MSC numbers. MSC reduction can be observed even before the clinical onset of aGvHD (n = 10). Assessing MSCs instantly after biopsy collection revealed phenotypic and functional differences depending on the occurrence of aGvHD. These differences vanished during ex vivo expansion. The MSC endotypes observed revealed an enhanced population of donor-derived classical dendritic cells type 1 and alloreactive T cells as the causing agent for compartmental inflammation and MSC damage before clinical onset of aGvHD was ascertained. In conclusion, MSCs endotypes may constitute a predisposing conductor of alloreactivity after alloHCT preceding the clinical diagnosis of aGvHD. ",

Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was executed to recognize module genes associated with radiotherapy. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between different radiotherapy response groups were filtered via edgeR package. The differentially expressed radiotherapy-related autophagy genes (DERRAGs) were obtained by overlapping the module genes, DEGs, and autophagy genes (ATGs). Then, prognostic autophagy genes were selected by Cox analyses, and a risk model and nomogram were subsequently built. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) were performed to investigate potential mechanisms through which prognostic autophagy signatures regulate LUAD. Radiotherapy-resistant cell lines (A549IR and PC9IR) were established after exposure to hypo-fractionated irradiation. Ultimately, mRNA expression was validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and relative protein levels were measured in different cell lines by western blot. A total of 11 DERRAGs were identified in LUAD. After Cox analyses, SHC1, NAPSA, and AURKA were filtered as prognostic signatures in LUAD. Then, the risk score model was constructed using the prognostic signatures, which had a good performance in predicting the prognosis, as evidenced by receiver operating characteristics curves. Furthermore, Cox regression analyses demonstrated that risk score was deemed as an independent prognostic factor in LUAD. Moreover, GSEA and ssGSEA results revealed that prognostic RRAGs may regulate LUAD by modulating the immune microenvironment and affecting cell proliferation. The colony formation assay showed that the radiosensitivity of radiation-resistant cell lines was lower than that of primary cells. The western blot assay found that the levels of autophagy were elevated in the radiotherapy-resistant cell lines. Moreover, the expression of DERRAGs (SHC1, AURKA) was higher in the radiotherapy-resistant cells than in primary cells.

In 12 large studies conducted by the HIV Vaccine Trial Network (HVTN) (n=1470 individuals), we find wide variation among participants in the pre-vaccine levels of gp41-reactive antibodies as measured by the binding antibody multiplex assay (BAMA).

When patients are diagnosed, there is little chance that surgery will be beneficial. Systemic chemotherapy is the currently accepted treatment option for patients with metastatic advanced pancreatic cancer. However, a very limited survival improvement is possible with chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer, and chemotherapy resistance plays a significant role in poor prognosis. Despite the fact that targeting growth factor receptor inhibitors such as anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR) antibodies significantly improves survival in pancreatic cancer, only a very small number of patients benefit from the treatment. As emerging drugs, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have demonstrated significant therapeutic effects in several tumor types, but monotherapy is not effective in pancreatic cancer. In the first-line treatment of solid tumors, combination therapy may result in remarkable outcomes. Here in, we have reported a younger patient with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with liver metastasis (PDACLM) who had a long-term partial response and good tolerance to the combination of anlotinib and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor and chemotherapy. Gene analysis suggested only one mutation in the Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS) G12V gene. Consequently, there is some hope for patients with pancreatic cancer, especially for KRAS G12V gene mutated patients. Upon reviewing the literature, this patient's combination therapy is the first to have been reported. ",

        "AbstractText": "RCSD1 is a cytoskeletal regulator that has been confirmed to undergo genetic mutations in hematological tumors, but the mechanisms of RCSD1 in pan-cancer and its impact on patient prognosis have not been studied. Using TCGA, GEPIA, UALCAN, Kaplan-Meier plotters, Linkedomics, String, cBioPortal, TISIDB, TCIA and TIMER database methods, we investigated the expression of RCSD1 in human tumors and its relationship to clinical prognosis, functional analysis of co-expression networks, mutation status, and immune infiltration in cancers, especially lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). The expression of RCSD1 is low in most tumors compared with normal tissues, and its high expression is associated with good patient survival. The RCSD1 co-expression network is mainly involved in the regulation of immune response. In human cancer, RCSD1 plays an important role in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and is significantly associated with the expression of immune infiltrating cells (TIL) in lung cancer. As a prognostic biomarker of generalized cancer, RCSD1 is associated with immune infiltration. ",

        "AbstractText": "An mRNA with unmodified nucleosides induces type I interferons (IFN-I) through the stimulation of innate immune sensors. Whether IFN-I induced by mRNA vaccine is crucial for anti-tumor immune response remains to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the immunogenicity and anti-tumor responses of mRNA encoding tumor antigens with different degrees of N1-methylpseudouridine (m1&#936;) modification in B16 melanoma model. Our results demonstrated that ovalbumin (OVA) encoding mRNA formulated in a lipid nanoparticle (OVA-LNP) induced substantial IFN-I production and the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) with negative correlation with increasing percentages of m1&#936; modification. In B16-OVA murine melanoma model, unmodified OVA-LNP significantly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival, compared to OVA-LNP with m1&#936; modification. This robust anti-tumor effect correlated with the increase in intratumoral CD40+ DCs and the frequency of granzyme B+/IFN-&#947;+/TNF-&#945;+ polyfunctional OVA peptide-specific CD8+ T cells. Blocking type I IFN receptor completely reversed the anti-tumor immunity of unmodified mRNA-OVA reflected in a significant decrease in OVA-specific IFN-&#947; secreting T cells and enrichment of PD-1+ tumor-infiltrating T cells. The robust anti-tumor effect of unmodified OVA-LNP was also observed in the lung metastatic tumor model. Finally, this mRNA vaccine was tested using B16 melanoma neoantigens (Pbk-Actn4) which resulted in delayed tumor growth. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that an unmodified mRNA vaccine induces IFN-I production or the downstream signaling cascades which plays a crucial role in inducing robust anti-tumor T cell response for controlling tumor growth and metastasis.

But unlike AQP4-IgG&#8201;+&#8201;NMOSD, which is known to coexist with various autoimmune diseases and cancers, an association of MOGAD with these conditions is less clear. We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA). Duplicates were removed using Mendeley 1.19.8 (USA production) and the citations were uploaded into Covidence systematic review platform for screening. The most common autoimmune disease overlapping with MOGAD was anti-N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor encephalitis (anti-NMDAR-EN), followed by autoimmune thyroid disorders, and the most common autoantibody was antinuclear antibody (ANA), followed by AQP4-IgG (double-positive MOG-IgG and AQP4-IgG). A few sporadic cases of cancers and MOG-IgG-associated paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis were found. Unlike AQP4-IgG&#8201;+&#8201;NMOSD, MOGAD lacks clustering of autoimmune diseases and autoantibodies associated with systemic and organ-specific autoimmunity. Other than anti-NMDAR-EN and perhaps AQP4-IgG&#8201;+&#8201;NMOSD, the evidence thus far does not support the need for routine screening of overlapping autoimmunity and neoplasms in patients with MOGAD.

Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) serve important roles in numerous cellular functions, and dysregulation of FGFs contributes to various cancer types. However, there are few reports on the function of FGFs in PAAD. The Assistant for Clinical Bioinformatics database, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, Kaplan-Meier plotter and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource were utilized to perform the protein-protein interaction network, functional enrichment, univariate Cox regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox, differential expression, prognostic value and immune cell infiltration analyses of FGFs in patients with PAAD. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to verify the predictive value of the model. A total of 22 FGF genes were identified. Based on the results of LASSO Cox regression analysis, a total of six genes, including FGF2, FGF8, FGF9, FGF13, FGF17 and FGF22, were selected for the establishment of the prognostic gene signature. High transcriptional levels of FGF17 and FGF22 were significantly associated with long overall survival. The expression of FGFs was associated with the infiltration of various immune cells. According to univariate and multivariate analyses, FGF2 and FGF8 may be useful independent prognostic biomarkers for the prognosis of patients with PAAD. IHC demonstrated that FGF2 and FGF8 were more highly expressed in PAAD tissues compared with that in normal tissues. The present findings offer a novel understanding for the selection of FGF prognostic biomarkers in PAAD. ",

        "AbstractText": "Breast cancer is a severe disease with high incidence and mortality rates in menopausal women. Previous studies have shown that nutritional status and inflammation play a significant role in the development of breast cancer. However, whether serum albumin (ALB) and neutrophils (NE) accelerate the progression of this disease remains unclear. In the present study, a total of 94 cases of newly diagnosed metastatic breast cancer were assessed. For analysis, 26 risk factors including ALB and NE were assessed. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was then used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) after adjusting for continuous and categorical covariates. Compared with the control group, patients with disease progression, low levels of ALB, higher NE, counts, and higher neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio counts were associated with worse overall survival (OS). When these risk factors were fitted into a multivariate regression model, progression [P<0.001, HR=3.03 (1.62-5.66)], NE counts &#8805;3.370&#215;109 [P=0.004, HR=2.15 (1.27-3.65)] and ALB levels <43.275 g/l [P=0.008, HR=0.47 (0.27-0.82)] remained statistically significant factors for a worse OS. These independently associated risk factors were used to form an OS estimation nomogram. The constructed nomogram demonstrated good accuracy in estimating risk, with a bootstrap-corrected C index of 0.686. We further collected data on 30 patients for external validation and found the nomogram had an accuracy of 83.3%. In conclusion, low serum ALB levels and increased NE counts were predictive of a poorer prognosis in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

        "AbstractText": "Breast cancer (BC) in women is the second most commonly diagnosed type of cancer worldwide, and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women. To date, surgery is the main treatment option, often combined with other (neo)adjuvant therapeutic modalities to treat this malignancy and prevent relapse. Despite the invasive aspects of the majority of these therapeutic interventions and their associated side-effects, these treatments are still unable to effectively cure this disease and prevent relapse. Thus, there is an urgent need for the identification of more relevant biomarkers for more effective theranostics. Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule F7 (SLAMF7) is a glycosylated cell surface protein that plays a critical role in immune cell functions under both healthy conditions and in cancer. It is specifically targeted by elotuzumab for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The present retrospective study aimed to investigate the expression patterns of SLAMF7 and evaluate its associations with clinicopathological features, including the survival outcomes of patients with BC. The protein expression of SLAMF7 in BC was investigated in 278 lymph node-positive formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks using tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry techniques. The results revealed a significant association between cytoplasmic SLAMF7 protein expression and several clinicopathological parameters, particularly age at diagnosis (P<0.007), tumor invasion (P<0.008) and vascular invasion (P=0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the overexpression of SLAMF7 was a strong positive prognosticator of both disease-free and disease-specific survival in the patients with BC (log-rank P=0.001 and P=0.008, respectively). This suggests that patients with SLAMF7 protein expression have a higher survival rate and a lower recurrence rate. On the whole, the present study demonstrated that a weak or no SLAMF7 expression was a powerful prognosticator of poor survival outcomes associated with both tumor and vascular invasion. Therefore, elotuzumab (as SLAMF7monoclonal antibody therapy) may be a promising option for targeted therapy worthy of clinical testing in patients with BC. ",

The prognosis of tumors is poor and the quality of life of patients is low. In addition to traditional surgical and non-surgical treatment, combined treatments are more effective for patients with distant metastatic melanoma. Due to the high immunogenicity of vaginal malignant melanoma, immunotherapy has become an effective treatment strategy for distant metastatic vaginal melanoma, and with the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), outstanding achievements have been made in the treatment of the disease. Studies have shown that ICIs combined with radiotherapy (RT) or anti-angiogenic therapy can have a synergistic effect in certain tumor treatments, normalizing blood vessels and enhancing immune responses. However, whether ICIs combined with RT and anti-angiogenic therapy can benefit patients with distant metastatic vaginal melanoma remains unclear. The present study reports the clinical case of a patient with distant metastatic vaginal melanoma treated with combined RT, anti-angiogenic therapy and ICIs. The patient's primary tumor and distant metastases improved after combination therapy. The combination therapy successfully improved the patient's prognosis and prolonged the patient's overall survival.

The prostate specific antigen (PSA) test for PCa remains controversial. Therefore, the development of more effective non-invasive biomarkers for PCa is necessary. The present study evaluated the diagnostic value of microRNA (miR)-20b-5p in PCa. Tissue miR-20b-5p expression levels and their correlation with clinical parameters were assessed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets, and the diagnostic value of the miR-20b-5p expression levels in PCa tissues was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to assess the relative expression levels of miR-20b-5p in PCa tissues compared with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) tissues. In addition, miR-20b-5p expression levels in PCa cell lines and non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial cells were compared. In this study, exosomes were extracted from the prostatic fluid as a source of liquid biopsy for the detection of PCa. The prostatic fluid exosomal miR-20b-5p expression levels between patients with PCa and the biopsy-negative patients were compared, and the diagnostic efficiency of prostatic fluid exosomal miR-20b-5p expression levels in PCa was compared with PSA and with the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) risk calculator. The mechanism by which miR-20b-5p may function in PCa was assessed using bioinformatic analysis and validation experiments. miR-20b-5p was expressed at a markedly higher level in PCa tissues compared with normal prostate tissues with high diagnostic efficiency (area under the curve: 0.826). The expression levels of miR-20b-5p were also significantly higher in PCa tissues compared with BPH tissues; similarly, miR-20b-5p was more highly expressed in PCa cells compared with non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial cells. Prostatic fluid exosomal miR-20b-5p expression levels in patients with PCa were significantly higher compared with confirmed to be biopsy-negative, and the diagnostic performance of miR-20b-5p was superior to PSA and ERSPC risk calculator. The results of RT-qPCR and western blotting following transfection of DU145 cells with miR-20b-5p mimics and inhibitor showed that miR-20b-5p reduced the expression of retinoblastoma-associated protein 1 (RB1). Therefore, RB1 may be a significant target gene for miR-20b-5p. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that miR-20b-5p was upregulated in PCa at the tissue and cellular levels, as well as in prostatic fluid exosomes. Therefore, miR-20b-5p may be a promising early diagnostic biomarker for PCa and an important tool to guide the decision-making of prostate biopsy. ",

This study aims to find barriers and facilitators in the implementation process of National Cervical Cancer Screening Program in Rural Areas (NACCSPRA) in China through program evaluation, and thus propose suggestions for optimization of the program. Through stratified sampling, 8 provinces (autonomous cities/districts) in eastern, southern, western, northern, and central China were selected for evaluation of NACCSPRA based on the RE-AIM framework. We obtained 15 program providers' experience and perspectives through semi-structured interviews. The data was analyzed using a combination of deductive and inductive analysis methods. The study found that NACCSPRA mainly serves women with rural household registration or urban minimum living guarantee. Population mobility and certain demographic characteristics such as low education and poor health awareness are common participation barriers, while program publicity acts as a facilitator. A screening program's direct benefit is to promote early detection and treatment of cervical cancer, and its perceived indirect effect is to raise people's health awareness. The proportion of regions adopting the project is relatively high, and factors affecting employees' participation are screening workload, working environment, welfare benefits, degree of preference for grassroots work, and whether the project is included in the performance appraisal; In terms of implementation, there are disparities in screening methods, network informatization levels, and capital investment in various regions. Poor development of screening information system and insufficient screening funds are significant barriers to improvement of project implementation. In contrast, the overall implementation of follow-up is better; related policies issued by the local government and financial subsidies for poor women ensure the maintenance of the project. Shortage of funds is an important problem faced by current screening project, which negatively influences upgrade of cervical cancer prevention strategy, implementors' working environment, and impedes improvement of information network. In addition, defects in population coverage, especially in mobile population also deserves attention.

The selected indicators were classified into six domains based on the continuum of cancer care and survivor's life cycle, namely, primary prevention (61, 24.0%), secondary prevention (46, 18.1%), treatment (85, 33.5%), quality of care (33, 13.0%), survivor management (33, 13.0%), and end-of-life care (14, 5.5%). There is a growing interest in developing specific areas of cancer care. Cancer indicators can help organizations, care providers, and patients strive for optimal care outcomes. The identified indicators could guide future innovations by identifying weaknesses in cancer prevention and management. ",

        "ArticleTitle": "Time series models show comparable projection performance with joinpoint regression: A comparison using historical cancer data from World Health Organization. ",
        "AbstractText": "Cancer is one of the major causes of death and the projection of cancer incidences is essential for future healthcare resources planning. Joinpoint regression and average annual percentage change (AAPC) are common approaches for cancer projection, while time series models, traditional ways of trend analysis in statistics, were considered less popular. This study aims to compare these projection methods on seven types of cancers in 31 geographical jurisdictions. Using data from 66 cancer registries in the World Health Organization, projection models by joinpoint regression, AAPC, and autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous variables (ARIMAX) were constructed based on 20 years of cancer incidences. The rest of the data upon 20-years of record were used to validate the primary outcomes, namely, 3, 5, and 10-year projections. Weighted averages of mean-square-errors and of percentage errors on predictions were used to quantify the accuracy of the projection results. Among 66 jurisdictions and seven selected cancers, ARIMAX gave the best 5 and 10-year projections for most of the scenarios. When the ten-year projection was concerned, ARIMAX resulted in a mean-square-error (or percentage error) of 2.7% (or 7.2%), compared with 3.3% (or 15.2%) by joinpoint regression and 7.8% (or 15.0%) by AAPC. All the three methods were unable to give reasonable projections for prostate cancer incidence in the US. ARIMAX outperformed the joinpoint regression and AAPC approaches by showing promising accuracy and robustness in projecting cancer incidence rates. In the future, developments in projection models and better applications could promise to improve our ability to understand the trend of disease development, design the intervention strategies, and build proactive public health system.

        "ArticleTitle": "A protocol for applying health equity-informed implementation science models and frameworks to adapt a sleep intervention for adolescents at risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. ",
        "AbstractText": "Effective and equitable strategies to prevent youth suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) are an urgent public health priority. Adolescent sleep disturbances are robustly linked to STB but are rarely addressed in preventive interventions or among Black and/or Hispanic/Latinx youth for whom STB risk is increasing disproportionately. This paper describes an application of health equity-informed implementation science models and frameworks to adapt and evaluate the evidence-based Transdiagnostic Sleep and Circadian (TSC) intervention for primary care implementation with adolescents of minoritized backgrounds with depression and STB risk. This multiphase study protocol uses the Assessment, Decision, Adaptation, Production, Topical Experts-Integration, Training, Testing (ADAPT-ITT) model to adapt and evaluate TSC for primary care implementation with adolescents who are depressed, at risk for STB, and of primarily Black and/or Hispanic/Latinx backgrounds. We integrate the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) in an initial qualitative inquiry of adolescent, caregiver, and clinician perceptions of TSC. Subsequent ADAPT-ITT phases include systematically and iteratively testing adaptations based on the qualitative inquiry, with ongoing key informant input, and then evaluating the adapted TSC for feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy in a pilot randomized trial. Based on youth depression and sleep health disparities research, we expect that TSC adaptations will be needed to enhance intervention content for adolescents with depression, STB risk, and primarily Black and/or Hispanic/Latinx backgrounds. We also anticipate adaptations will be needed to align TSC delivery methods with primary care implementation. Adapting evidence-based interventions with end-users and contexts in mind can help ensure that intervention strategies and delivery methods are acceptable to, and feasible with, health disparate populations. Although TSC has shown effectiveness for adolescents with sleep disturbances, we expect that additional multiphase research is necessary to optimize TSC for primary care delivery with Black and/or Hispanic/Latinx adolescents with depression and STB risk.

        "AbstractText": "We disclose novel amphiphilic ruthenium and osmium complexes that auto-assemble into nanomedicines with potent antiproliferative activity by inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. The self-assembling units were rationally designed from the [M(p-cymene)(1,10-phenanthroline)Cl]PF6 motif (where M is either RuII or OsII) with an appended C16 fatty chain to achieve high cellular activity, nano-assembling and mitochondrial targeting. These amphiphilic complexes block cell proliferation at the sub-micromolar range and are particularly potent towards glioblastoma neurospheres made from patient-derived cancer stem cells. A subcutaneous mouse model using these glioblastoma stem cells highlights one of our C16 OsII nanomedicines as highly successful in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that they act as metabolic poisons, strongly impairing mitochondrial respiration, corroborated by morphological changes and damage to the mitochondria. A genetic strategy based on RNAi gave further insight on the potential involvement of microtubules as part of the induced cell death. In parallel, we examined the structural properties of these new amphiphilic metal-based constructs, their reactivity and mechanism. ",

        "AbstractText": "Despite advances in periodontal disease (PD) research and periodontal treatments, 42% of the US population suffer from periodontitis. PD can be prevented if high-risk patients are identified early to provide preventive care. Prediction models can help assess risk for PD before initiation and progression; nevertheless, utilization of existing PD prediction models is seldom because of their suboptimal performance. This study aims to develop and test the PD prediction model using machine learning (ML) and electronic dental record (EDR) data that could provide large sample sizes and up-to-date information. A cohort of 27,138 dental patients and grouped PD diagnoses into: healthy control, mild PD, and severe PD was generated. The ML model (XGBoost) was trained (80% training data) and tested (20% testing data) with a total of 74 features extracted from the EDR. We used a five-fold cross-validation strategy to identify the optimal hyperparameters of the model for this one-vs.-all multi-class classification task. Our prediction model differentiated healthy patients vs. mild PD cases and mild PD vs. severe PD cases with an average area under the curve of 0.72. New associations and features compared to existing models were identified that include patient-level factors such as patient anxiety, chewing problems, speaking trouble, teeth grinding, alcohol consumption, injury to teeth, presence of removable partial dentures, self-image, recreational drugs (Heroin and Marijuana), medications affecting periodontium, and medical conditions such as osteoporosis, cancer, neurological conditions, infectious diseases, endocrine conditions, cardiovascular diseases, and gastroenterology conditions. This pilot study demonstrated promising results in predicting the risk of PD using ML and EDR data. The model may provide new information to the clinicians about the PD risks and the factors responsible for the disease progression to take preventive approaches. Further studies are warned to evaluate the prediction model's performance on the external dataset and determine its usability in clinical settings. ",

        "ArticleTitle": "Recent advances in understanding telomere diseases. ",
        "AbstractText": "Germline genetic defects impairing telomere length maintenance may result in severe medical conditions in humans, from aplastic anemia and myeloid neoplasms to interstitial lung disease and liver cirrhosis, from childhood (dyskeratosis congenita) to old age (pulmonary fibrosis). The molecular mechanisms underlying these clinically distinct disorders are pathologically excessive telomere erosion, limiting cell proliferation and differentiation, tissue regeneration, and increasing genomic instability. Recent findings also indicate that telomere shortening imbalances stem cell fate and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response and the senescent-associated secretory phenotype. Bone marrow failure is the most common phenotype in patients with telomere diseases. Pulmonary fibrosis is a typical phenotype in older patients, and disease progression appears faster than in pulmonary fibrosis not associated with telomeropathies. Liver cirrhosis may present in isolation or in combination with other phenotypes. Diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion and may be confirmed by telomere length measurement and genetic testing. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques have improved genetic testing; today, at least 16 genes have been implicated in telomeropathies. NGS also allows tracking of clonal hematopoiesis and malignant transformation. Patients with telomere diseases are at high risk of developing cancers, including myeloid neoplasms and head and neck cancer. However, treatment options are still limited. Transplant modalities (bone marrow, lung, and liver) may be definitive to the respective organ involvement but limited by donor availability, comorbidities, and impact on other affected organs. In clinical trials, androgens elongate telomeres of peripheral blood leukocytes and improve hematopoiesis. Further understanding of how telomere erosion impairs organ function and how somatic mutations evolve in the hematopoietic tissue may help develop new strategies to treat and prevent telomere diseases.

Pilomatricomas may undergo calcification and ossification although the latter is rare and poorly documented, with only eight cases reported since 2006. We present a case of pilomatricoma with osseous metaplasia arising from the scalp in an 87-year-old female patient.&#160;She was referred by her general practitioner via the two-week cancer referral pathway, for a suspicious lesion. On examination, there was a 2 x 1cm nodule, with protruding hardened yellow material, on the right side of the patient's occipital scalp. The lump was hard, non-tender&#160;and had been present for 17 years. The surrounding area was bleeding and slightly ulcerated. A clinical diagnosis of a ruptured epidermal cyst was made, and the patient was prepared for excision under local anaesthesia.&#160;The excised lesion of 23 x 18 x 10mm with 22 x 9mm of skin was sent for histology. This revealed a partially ulcerated dermal lesion composed of islands of keratin with 'ghost cell' outlines. Foreign body granulomas, transition to mature lamellar bone, and foci of calcification were noted.&#160;There were no definite populations of basaloid cells and features of malignancy were not seen. These findings are consistent with benign pilomatricoma with osseous metaplasia. The patient was discharged 4 weeks later with satisfactory wound healing. Differentiating this tumour from other commonly encountered benign masses remains a challenge, as seen in this case which was initially misdiagnosed as a ruptured epidermal cyst. ",

        "AbstractText": "This is a&#160;pilot study to assess the utility of applying 5G-assisted remote guidance in laparoscopic simulation training. A single trainee of a junior surgeon was recruited to complete three steps of tasks including basic task 1, basic task 2, and model task, and the performance was recorded and evaluated. The operator completed each task three times. Except for basic task 1, all tasks were remotely guided by a more experienced surgeon using 5G technology. Tasks completion time and a 30-point objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS) score were utilized to assess the results of simulation training. All remote guidance processes were successfully completed without significant network latency. Through basic task 1, the operator quickly became familiar with the trained laparoscopic instruments. For basic task 2, OSATS scores increased from 16 to 24 points, and completion time decreased from 1500 to 986&#160;s after training under 5G-assisted remote guidance. For model tasks, OSATS scores increased from 15 to 26 points, and completion time decreased from 1734 to 1142&#160;s. This is a novel mode of laparoscopic simulation training to increase the convenience of training. Perhaps in the near future, surgeons can simulate difficult operations at home or in the office, and accurately grasp the possible situations that may occur in actual operations in advance.

        "AbstractText": "Lung cancer presents one of the most challenging carcinomas with meager 5-year survival rates (less than 20%), high metastasis and high recurrence due to chemo- and radio- resistance. An alternative or complementation to existing prognosis modalities is the use of phytochemicals such as silibinin, which targets essential cytokines, angiogenic factors and transcription factors for a profound anti-tumor effect. However, the problems of low solubility in an aqueous physiological environment, poor penetration, high metabolism and rapid systemic clearance limit the therapeutic use of silibinin. Conjugation of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) with silibinin may overcome the above challenges along with distinct advantages of biocompatibility, optical properties for monitoring and causation of cytotoxicity in cancer cells. The current study thus aims to develop silibinin conjugated gold nanoparticles (Sb-GNPs) with pH responsive release in the cancer microenvironment, optimizing several parameters for its higher activity and further evaluate the nanoplatform for their efficacy in inducing cell death in vitro against A549 lung cancer cells. GNPs was synthesized using trisodium citrate dihydrate as the reducing agent and further used for the conjugation of silibinin. The synthesized GNPs were found to be monodispersed and spherical in shape. The silibinin was successfully conjugated with gold nanoparticles and long-term stability of GNPs and Sb-GNPs nanoconjugates in suspension phase was confirmed by FTIR and DLS. Anticancer properties of Sb-GNPs were confirmed by different assay using MTT, Trypan blue dye exclusion assay and cell cycle analysis assay. After conjugation of silibinin with GNPs, the efficacy of silibinin increased 4-5 times in killing the cancer cells. This is the first report on using silibinin gold nanoconjugate system for lung cancer therapy with promising future applications. ",

        "AbstractText": "Advanced clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) is notoriously known for its poor prognosis. Synapse defective protein 1 homolog 2 encoded by the SYDE2 gene is a Rho GTPase-activating protein whose functional tumorigenic significance is still unclear. Recent pan-cancer analysis using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data showed the potential tumor-suppressing effects of SYDE2 in ccRCC. Subsequently, the TCGA, GTEx data, and human protein atlas were employed to assess the correlation between the SYDE2 expression, clinical data, and overall survival (OS) in ccRCC patients. Furthermore, microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) contributing to SYDE2 down expression were identified by expression, relationship, and survival analysis. Eventually, two novel lncRNAs, AL162377.1 and AF111167.2, targeting the miR-21-5p axis, were identified in the SYDE2 upstream non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs)-related pathway in ccRCC. The expression level of SYDE2 highly depends on the tumor immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression.

We first compared the transcriptomes of malignant plasma cells from newly diagnosed MM patients who were risk-categorized based on the patient-specific EMC-92/SKY-92 gene expression signature values vs. normal plasma cells from healthy volunteers using archived datasets from the HOVON65/GMMG-HD4 randomized Phase 3 study evaluating the clinical efficacy of bortezomib induction/maintenance versus classic cytotoxic drugs and thalidomide maintenance. In particular, ERBB1/EGFR was significantly overexpressed in MM cells in comparison to normal control plasma cells, and it was differentially overexpressed in MM cells from high-risk patients. Amplified expression of EGFR/ERBB1 mRNA in MM cells was positively correlated with increased expression levels of mRNAs for several DNA binding proteins and transcription factors with known upregulating activity on EGFR/ERBB1 gene expression. MM patients with the highest ERBB1/EGFR expression level had significantly shorter PFS and OS times than patients with the lowest ERBB1/EGFR expression level. High expression levels of EGFR/ERBB1 were associated with significantly increased hazard ratios for unfavorable PFS and OS outcomes in both univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. The impact of high EGFR/ERBB1 expression on the PFS and OS outcomes remained significant even after accounting for the prognostic effects of other covariates. These results regarding the prognostic effect of EGFR/ERBB1 expression were validated using the MMRF-CoMMpass RNAseq dataset generated in patients treated with more recently applied drug combinations included in contemporary induction regimens.

        "AbstractText": "Purpose: To explore the effect of blood flow restriction training (BFRT) on the recovery of knee function in patients after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM). Methods: Forty patients undergoing APM surgery were included in this parallel group, two-arm, single-assessor blinded, randomized clinical trial. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups: routine rehabilitation group (RR Group, n = 20) and routine rehabilitation + blood flow restriction training group (RR + BFRT Group, n = 20). One subject in each group dropped out during the experiment. All patients received 8&#160;weeks of routine rehabilitation starting from the second day after APM. In addition, patients in the RR + BFRT group required additional BFRT twice a week. Visual analogue scale (VAS) score, range of motion (ROM), one-leg standing test (OLST) score, Lysholm knee score, quadriceps muscle strength, quadriceps thickness, and thigh circumference were evaluated at preoperative, postoperative, 4 and 8&#160;weeks after surgery. SPSS 25.0 software was used for statistical analysis of the data. Repeated measures ANOVA was used if the data were normally distributed and had homogeneity of variance. Generalized estimating equations were chosen if the data were not normally distributed or had homogeneity of variance. Results: There were no significant differences in VAS score, ROM, OLST score, Lysholm knee score, quadriceps muscle strength, quadriceps thickness, and thigh circumference between the two groups before surgery (p > 0.05). Compared with postoperative, VAS score, ROM, OLST score, Lysholm knee score, and thigh circumference were significantly improved in the RR group (p < 0.05), while quadriceps muscle strength and quadriceps thickness were not significantly enhanced at 8&#160;weeks postoperatively (p > 0.05). However, VAS score, ROM, OLST score, Lysholm knee score, quadriceps muscle strength, quadriceps thickness, and thigh circumference were all significantly improved in the RR + BFRT group at 8&#160;weeks postoperatively (p < 0.05). Furthermore, compared with the RR group, VAS score (50% vs. 86%), ROM (7.9% vs. 16.0%), OLST score (57.3% vs. 130.1%), Lysholm knee score (38.4% vs. 55.7%), relative peak torque (11.0% vs. 84.7%), mean power (20.6% vs. 88.1%), rectus femoris thickness (0.40% vs. 13.0%), vastus medialis (0.29% vs. 5.32%), vastus lateralis (0% vs. 6.2%), vastus internus (0% vs. 5.8%), and thigh circumference (2.7% vs. 5.8%) in the RR + BFRT group were significantly improved at 4 and 8&#160;weeks postoperatively (p < 0.05). Conclusion: BFRT combined with routine rehabilitation training can better promote the recovery of knee joint function in patients after APM, especially the improvement of quadriceps muscle strength and thickness.

        "AbstractText": "Objectives: We aimed to establish machine learning models based on texture analysis predicting pelvic lymph node metastasis (PLNM) and expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in cervical cancer with PET/CT negative pelvic lymph node (PLN). Methods: Eight hundred and thirty-seven texture features were extracted from PET/CT images of 148 early-stage cervical cancer patients with negative PLN. The machine learning models were established by logistic regression from selected features and evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC). The correlation of selected PET/CT texture features predicting PLNM or COX-2 expression and the corresponding immunohistochemical (IHC) texture features was analyzed by the Spearman test. Results: Fourteen texture features were reserved to calculate the Rad-score for PLNM and COX-2. The PLNM model predicting PLNM showed good prediction accuracy in the training and testing dataset (AUC = 0.817, p < 0.001; AUC = 0.786, p < 0.001, respectively). The COX-2 model also behaved well for predicting COX-2 expression levels in the training and testing dataset (AUC = 0.814, p < 0.001; AUC = 0.748, p = 0.001). The wavelet-LHH-GLCM ClusterShade of the PET image selected to predict PLNM was slightly correlated with the corresponding feature of the IHC image (r = -0.165, p < 0.05). There was a weak correlation of wavelet-LLL-GLRLM LongRunEmphasis of the PET image selected to predict COX-2 correlated with the corresponding feature of the IHC image (r = 0.238, p < 0.05). The correlation between PET image selected to predict COX-2 and the corresponding feature of the IHC image based on wavelet-LLL-GLRLM LongRunEmphasis is considered weak positive (r = 0.238, p=<0.05). Conclusion: This study underlined the significant application of the machine learning models based on PET/CT texture analysis for predicting PLNM and COX-2 expression, which could be a novel tool to assist the clinical management of cervical cancer with negative PLN on PET/CT images.

This paper proposes a gradient Boosted Trees algorithm for Spatial Data (Boost-S) with covariate information. Boost-S integrates the spatial correlation into the classical framework of eXtreme Gradient Boosting. Each tree is constructed by solving a regularized optimization problem, where the objective function takes into account the underlying spatial correlation and involves two penalty terms on tree complexity. A computationally-efficient greedy heuristic algorithm is proposed to obtain an ensemble of trees. The proposed Boost-S is applied to the spatially-correlated FDG-PET (fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography) imaging data collected from clinical trials of cancer chemoradiotherapy. Our numerical investigations successfully demonstrate the advantages of the proposed Boost-S over existing approaches for this particular application. ",

        "AbstractText": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, multi phenotypic, autoimmune inflammatory disease and renal involvement significantly worsens its prognosis. Apoptosis dysregulation plays a key pathogenic role. Survivin, a protein from the apoptosis inhibitors family, has been considered a promising strategy in cancer therapy and evaluated as one of the regulatory pathways in the scenario of immune-mediated disorders. This study aims to explore survivin behaviour in SLE patients with lupus nephritis (LN), assessing its potential as a therapeutic and prognostic biomarker. 297 SLE patients were classified based on the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1997 criteria, from 2000 to 2015. In a cross-sectional study, the serum level of survivin was measured by an ELISA test and compared between 200 SLE individuals and healthy controls. In a longitudinal cohort, 97 patients with active LN had the concentration of survinin measured, before and after treatment with cyclophosphamide pulse therapy. The serum concentration of survivin was significantly lower in the SLE group than in healthy controls, regardless of concomitant NL or disease activity. The longitudinal evaluation revealed a significant reduction in survivin serum level after treatment. However, survivin rates were not able to discriminate groups that achieved remission from those that maintained nephritis activity. Our study suggests that survivin levels in SLE patients are lower than in the general population. Even so, its use as a biomarker in SLE seems limited, not reflecting disease activity or response to LN treatment, as in other contexts. ",

However, their high surface energy leads to NPs aggregation, while non-targeted SPIONs can cause cytotoxic effects on normal cells. In this work, we evaluated the in vitro potential of polyethyleneimine (PEI)-SPIONs targeted by PNC-27 peptide as a double targeting agent throughout early cancer diagnosis. Initially, PEI was conjugated to PNC-27 with HDM-2-binding domain. Then, SPIONs were loaded into PEI-PNC-27 through the ligand exchange method. The physicochemical characteristics of the synthesized NPs were evaluated. The cytotoxicity and targeting efficiency were assayed against HT-29 and CT-26 cell lines along with NIH-3t3 as normal cells by MTT method and Prussian blue staining test, respectively. The mean diameter of synthesized carriers was obtained in the range of 86.6 - 116.1 nm with a positive charge. According to the cytotoxicity results, the binding and uptake abilities of the PNC-27 peptide by cancer cells were significantly higher than that of the NIH-3t3 cells. However, the results were indicative of the more toxic impacts of targeted synthesized NPs against CT-26 cancer cell line when being compared with HT-29 cells, which may be caused by the different cytotoxicity mechanisms of NPs. In addition, the targeted carriers and SPIONs were present inside and around the cells with HDM-2 expression along with only a few non-targeted vectors, while displaying no appearance throughout the normal cell. The results indicated the efficiency of targeted PEI-coated SPIONs for cancer diagnostic applications. ",

MicroRNA (miRNA) can be used as a prognostic marker for various human cancers. This study aims to detect suitable miRNA markers for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Our previous gene expression data of ESCC cells and the data from GSE43732 and GSE112840 were analyzed. The expression of miR-574-5p in ESCC patients and controls was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. The effect of miR-574-5p on proliferation was detected by real-time cell analysis (RTCA) and EdU proliferation assay after cell transfections. The target gene small C-terminal domain phosphatase 1 (CTDSP1) of miR-574-5p was validated by luciferase reporter assay and western blotting. In the current study, the bioinformatics analysis found miR-574-5p up-regulated in ESCC. The qPCR assay of 26 ESCC and 13 adjacent/ normal tissues confirmed these results. We further demonstrated that miR-574-5p overexpression promoted cell proliferation. Then the dual-luciferase reporter assay and the rescue experiment suggested that CTDSP1 was a direct target of miR-574-5p. MiR-574-5p played an oncological role in ESCC by interacting and negatively regulating CTDSP1. These results provided a deeper understanding of the effect of miR-574-5p on ESCC. ",

It has also been shown that silymarin, a flavonolignan extract of the plant, demonstrates chemopreventive effects against cancers. This patent review presents and discusses recent patents concerning the anticancer effects of S. marianum and silymarin. The data were gathered by searching an extensive literature review conducted in Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Google Patent, Patent Scope, and US Patent. Milk thistle and silymarin have been used in a variety of medical, therapeutic, and pharmaceutical fields, according to a large number of documents and patents. Milk thistle and silymarin have been used as complementary treatments for cancers such as skin, prostate, and colorectal cancers, as well as hepatoprotective agents. Silymarin exerts a chemopreventive effect on reactivating cell death pathways by modulation of the antiapoptotic proteins and synergizing with agonists of death domain receptors. Based on the results of these patents, silymarin could be beneficial to oncology patients, especially for the treatment of the side effects of anticancer chemotherapeutics. Following the human propensity to use phytocompounds rather than medicines based on chemical constituents, special attention must be paid to tie the value of milk thistle and silymarin from basic science to clinical applications.

        "AbstractText": "Although various studies have revealed the beneficial effects of crocin (derived from saffron), such as anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, antioxidant, and immune modulator, however, its exact mechanism is unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of crocin on the expression ratio of T-bet/GATA-3 as an indicator of altered immune responses in the lung tissue of ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized mice. In addition, the effect of crocin on the expression level of miR-146a and miR-106a in the lung tissue OVA-sensitized mice was investigated. Mice were randomly divided into five groups (n=6): Control; OVA, OVA + Crocin 25, OVA + Cro 50, and OVA + Cro100 groups. Crocin was administrated intraperitoneally at doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg for five consecutive days. One day after asthma induction, animals were euthanized, and lungs were sampled for pathological and gene expression analysis. OVA-sensitization led to increased inflammation and histopathological changes in the lung tissue of mice. In addition, GATA-3 expression increased (P<0.001) and T-bet expression decreased (P<0.001) in OVA-sensitized groups. The T-bet/GATA3 ratio was also reduced markedly in asthma groups (P<0.001). Furthermore, increased expression of miR-146a and miR-106a levels was evident in the lung tissue of OVA-sensitized mice (P<0.001 for both). Intervention with high concentrations of crocin (50 and 100 mg/kg) significantly reduced airway inflammation, GATA-3 expression, miR-146a expression, and miR-106a expression and corrected the T-bet/GATA-3 ratio (P<0.05 to P<0.001). Treatment with crocin led to a decrease in the severity of lung inflammation in OVA-sensitized mice, which is probably through the reduction of the T-bet/GATA-3 ratio, and mir-146a and mir-106a expression level.

        "AbstractText": "Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecologic cancer with an imperative need for new treatments. Immunotherapy has had marked success in some cancer types; however, clinical trials studying the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of EOC benefited less than 15% of patients. Given that EOC develops from multiple tissues in the reproductive system and metastasizes widely throughout the peritoneal cavity, responses to immunotherapy are likely hindered by heterogeneous tumor microenvironments (TME) containing a variety of immune profiles. To fully characterize and compare syngeneic model systems that may reflect this diversity, we determined the immunogenicity of six ovarian tumor models in vivo, the T and myeloid profile of orthotopic tumors and the immune composition and cytokine profile of ascites, by single-cell RNA sequencing, flow cytometry and IHC. The selected models reflect the different cellular origins of EOC (ovarian and fallopian tube epithelium) and harbor mutations relevant to human disease, including Tp53 mutation, PTEN suppression, and constitutive KRAS activation. ID8-p53-/- and ID8-C3 tumors were most highly infiltrated by T cells, whereas STOSE and MOE-PTEN/KRAS tumors were primarily infiltrated by tumor associated macrophages and were unique in MHC class I and II expression. MOE-PTEN/KRAS tumors were capable of forming T cell clusters. This panel of well-defined murine EOC models reflects some of the heterogeneity found in human disease and can serve as a valuable resource for studies that aim to test immunotherapies, explore the mechanisms of immune response to therapy, and guide selection of treatments for patient populations.

The increased immature neutrophils, Ly6C&#160;+&#160;CCR2hi monocytes, and S100a8hi macrophages induce an aggressive inflammatory response and eventually lead to the formation of fibrous capsule around the stainless steel implant. The enrichment of mature neutrophils, FcgR1hi and differentiated immunomodulatory macrophages around the titanium implant indicates favorable osseointegration under moderate immune response. Neutrophil-depletion mice are conducted to explore the role of neutrophils in osseointegration. Neutrophils may improve bone formation by enhancing the recruitment of BMSCs via the CXCL12/CXCR3 signal axis.

At present, initial treatment and postoperative adjuvant therapy are not conclusive, but early detection and early treatment are a consensus that can improve prognosis. Most of its occurrence has nothing to do with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Whether it is only negative for the subtypes that can be detected at present and whether it may be an unknown subtype of infection need to be further explored in the future.

On secondary analysis, previous chemotherapy for CRPC was a negative predictor of ALP response (OR&#8201;=&#8201;0.15, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.034). Elevated baseline ALP and PSA were associated with a lower rate of radium-223 regimen completion; receiving chemotherapy for CRPC prior to radium-223 was associated with a lower rate of ALP response.

        "AbstractText": "We describe the case of 74-year-old-male, previously treated with fronto-parietal craniotomy due to primary glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), followed by concurrent radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, at 1&#160;month after completing RT&#8201;+&#8201;TMZ, depicted partial response. Three months later, the patient was submitted to a further brain MRI, that resulted doubtful for therapy induced changes (i.e., pseudoprogression). The patient, who had been previously treated with prostatectomy for prostate cancer (PC), underwent a positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan with 18F-choline for PC biochemical recurrence. 18F-choline whole body PET/CT resulted negative for PC relapse, while segmental brain PET, co-registered with MRI, demonstrated increased tracer uptake corresponding to tumor boundaries. In order to solve differential diagnosis between pseudoprogression and GBM recurrence, brain PET/CT with 18F-L-dihydroxy-phenil-alanine (18F-DOPA) was subsequently performed: fused axial PET/MRI images showed increased 18F-DOPA incorporation in the peri-tumoral edema, but not in tumor boundaries, consistent with the suspicion of GBM pseudoprogression, as then confirmed by clinical and radiological follow-up.

The evaluation of educational needs (knowledge, attitudes, and practices) is important in controlling COVID-19 situations. The goal of this study is to find out what adults in Ardabil City know, how they feel, and what they do about the COVID-19 infection. In November 2021, a cross-sectional descriptive-correlational survey of 384 people was conducted using stratified-cluster sampling in Ardabil. The researchers created a self-reported questionnaire with 23 items as the data collection technique. The quantitative data were evaluated using descriptive statistics, the chi-square test, the correlation coefficient, and regression analysis. The correct answer rate for this research found that 73.17% of participants (n = 281) had appropriate knowledge, 61.19% (n = 235) had favorable attitudes, and 69.53% (n = 267) had enough practice behavior. However, knowledge was related to gender, employment, and location of residence. Age, marital status, education level, and location of residence were all connected with attitude. Age, gender, and marital status were all related to the behavior. The findings of linear regression analysis revealed that knowledge and attitude influence behavior. The study findings revealed a high degree of understanding of COVID-19, a positive attitude, and a strong commitment to good practices.

        "AbstractText": "We studied the innate and adaptive immune response against melanoma cells after JS-1 (wild-type herpes simplex virus 1, wt HSV-1) or Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) infection and evaluated the antitumoral efficacy in human melanoma cells. We analyzed the putative synergistic biological and immunological effects of JS-1 or T-VEC combined with cytostatic drugs in human tumor and immune cells. T-VEC is a genetically modified strain of HSV-1. Genetic modifications (insertion of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene) were made to attenuate the virus and increase selectivity for cancer cells. In addition to the direct oncolytic effect, we investigated the immune stimulatory effects of T-VEC by comparing it with JS-1. JS-1 is identical T-VEC except for the inserted GM-CSF gene. We analyzed the effects of T-VEC and JS-1 with cytostatic drugs in human tumor-immune cell coculture experiments. After coculture, the surface markers CD80, CD83 and CD86 were measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and the cytokines, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945; and GM-CSF, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Furthermore, we analyzed the potential of the viruses to induce T cell activation, measured on the basis of CD4, CD8 and CD69. Analysis of these markers and cytokines allows for conclusions to be drawn concerning the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and the immunostimulatory effects of the treatment. We documented increased activation of human cytotoxic T lymphocytes after infection by both HSV-1 strains and treatment with cytostatic drugs without significant differences between T-VEC and JS-1. We demonstrated an immune response as a result of infection with both viruses, but T-VEC was in vitro not stronger than JS-1. The immunostimulatory effects of the viruses could be partially increased by chemotherapy, providing a rationale for future preclinical studies designed to explore T-VEC in combined regimens. ",

        "AbstractText": "It is projected that in 5 years, pancreatic cancer will become the second deadliest cancer in the United States. A unique aspect of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is its stroma; rich in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and a dense CAF-generated extracellular matrix (ECM). These pathogenic stroma CAF/ECM units cause the collapse of local blood vessels rendering the tumor microenvironment nutrient-poor. PDAC cells are able to survive this state of nutrient stress via support from CAF-secreted material, which includes small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). The tumor-supportive CAFs possess a distinct phenotypic profile, compared to normal-like fibroblasts, expressing NetrinG1 (NetG1) at the plasma membrane, and active Integrin &#945;5&#946;1 localized to the multivesicular bodies; traits indicative of poor patient survival. We herein report that NetG1+ CAFs secrete sEVs that stimulate Akt-mediated survival in nutrient-deprived PDAC cells, protecting them from undergoing apoptosis. Further, we show that NetG1 expression in CAFs is required for the pro-survival properties of sEVs. Additionally, we report that the above-mentioned CAF markers are secreted in distinct subpopulations of EVs; with NetG1 being enriched in exomeres, and Integrin &#945;5&#946;1 being enriched in exosomes. Finally, we found that NetG1 and Integrin &#945;5&#946;1 were detected in sEVs collected from plasma of PDAC patients, while their levels were significantly lower in plasma-derived sEVs of sex/age-matched healthy donors. The discovery of these tumor-supporting CAF-EVs elucidates novel avenues in tumor-stroma interactions and pathogenic stroma detection. ",

Patients are scheduled to undergo a repeat prostate-specific antigen blood test, magnetic resonance imaging, a urology consultation, and, if indicated, prostate biopsies in a single morning. The histopathology report is available the next day, after which the biopsy results and treatment options are discussed via a telephone consultation. The project has included 122 patients so far. With a reduction to only one hospital visit per patient and just five appointments (4%) cancelled so far, this timely pathway seems to be efficient from a patient perspective. In addition, reducing the waiting time until histopathology diagnosis could decrease the anxiety and depression that patients may experience during the diagnostic workup for PCa. Therefore, we believe that this fast-track diagnostic pathway could be incorporated in the future European standard of care, bringing PCa care in line with other malignancies such as breast cancer. We describe a superfast diagnostic pathway for men at risk of prostate cancer. So far, this strategy seems to be an efficient and appropriate way to shorten time to diagnosis and to reduce the number of hospital visits for patients. ",

Azacitidine (AZA) is the standard care for high-risk MDS patients not eligible for allogenic bone marrow transplantation. However, only half of the patients respond to AZA and eventually all patients relapse. Response-predicting biomarkers and combinatorial drugs targets enhancing therapy response and its duration are needed. Here, we have taken a dual approach. First, we have evaluated genes encoding chromatin regulators for their capacity to modulate AZA response. We were able to validate several genes, whose genetic inhibition affected the cellular AZA response, including 4 genes encoding components of Imitation SWItch chromatin remodeling complex pointing toward a specific function and co-vulnerability. Second, we have used a classical cohort analysis approach measuring the expression of a gene panel in bone marrow samples from 36 MDS patients subsequently receiving AZA. The gene panel included the identified AZA modulators, genes known to be involved in AZA metabolism and previously identified candidate modulators. In addition to confirming a number of previously made observations, we were able to identify several new associations, such as NSUN3 that correlated with increased overall survival. Taken together, we have identified a number of genes associated with AZA response in vitro and in patients. These groups of genes are largely nonoverlapping suggesting that different gene sets need to be exploited for the development of combinatorial drug targets and response-predicting biomarkers. ",

Herein, we performed NGS on matched tissue and plasma samples from 146 Chinese patients with lung cancer. The concordance of variants between tissue and plasma samples was explored at patient and variant levels. More than 80% of patients harbored at least one concordant variant in tissue and plasma samples. A total of 506 variants were shared between tissue and plasma samples, and 432 variants were identified in tissue only and 92 variants were identified in plasma only. The sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of all variants detected in plasma were 53.9% and 84.6%, respectively. High concordance was observed in several driver genes.

        "AbstractText": "Advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) generally has poor outcomes and high mortality rates. Clarifying the molecular mechanisms underlying CRC progression is necessary to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to improve CRC outcome and decrease mortality. Transcriptional factor III A (GTF3A), an RNA polymerase III transcriptional factor, is a critical driver of tumorgenesis and aggravates CRC cell growth. To confirm whether GTF3A promotes CRC progression by regulating the expression of cystatin A (Csta) gene and investigate whether GTF3A can serve as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for patients with CRC. Human tissue microarrays containing 90 pairs of CRC tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues, and human tissue microarrays containing 20 pairs of CRC tissues, adjacent non-tumor tissues, and metastatic tissues were examined for GTF3A expression using immunohistochemistry. The survival rates of patients were analyzed. Short hairpin GTF3As and CSTAs were designed and packaged into the virus to block the expression of Gtf3a and Csta genes, respectively. In vivo tumor growth assays were performed to confirm whether GTF3A promotes CRC cell proliferation in vivo. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and fluorescence in situ hybridization assay were used to detect the interaction of GTF3A with Csta, whereas luciferase activity assay was used to evaluate the expression of the Gtf3a and Csta genes. RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) and data analyses were used to screen for target genes of GTF3A. The expression of GTF3A was higher in CRC tissues and lymph node metastatic tissues than in the adjacent normal tissues. GTF3A was associated with CRC prognosis, and knockdown of the Gtf3a gene impaired CRC cell proliferation, invasion, and motility in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, RNA-Seq analysis revealed that GTF3A might upregulate the expression of Csta, whereas the luciferase activity assay showed that GTF3A bound to the promoter of Csta gene and increased Csta transcription. Furthermore, CSTA regulated the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. GTF3A increases CSTA expression by binding to the Csta promoter, and increased CSTA level promotes CRC progression by regulating the EMT. Inhibition of GTF3A prevents CRC progression. Therefore, GTF3A is a potential novel therapeutic target and biomarker for CRC. ",

        "AbstractText": "Cuproptosis has recently been considered a novel form of programmed cell death. To date, long-chain non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) crucial to the regulation of this process remain unelucidated. To identify lncRNAs linked to cuproptosis in order to estimate patients' prognoses for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using RNA sequence data from The Cancer Genome Atlas Live Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC), a co-expression network of cuproptosis-related genes and lncRNAs was constructed. For HCC prognosis, we developed a cuproptosis-related lncRNA signature (CupRLSig) using univariate Cox, lasso, and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare overall survival among high- and low-risk groups stratified by median CupRLSig risk score. Furthermore, comparisons of functional annotation, immune infiltration, somatic mutation, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and pharmacologic options were made between high- and low-risk groups. Three hundred and forty-three patients with complete follow-up data were recruited in the analysis. Pearson correlation analysis identified 157 cuproptosis-related lncRNAs related to 14 cuproptosis genes. Next, we divided the TCGA-LIHC sample into a training set and a validation set. In univariate Cox regression analysis, 27 LncRNAs with prognostic value were identified in the training set. After lasso regression, the multivariate Cox regression model determined the identified risk equation as follows: Risk score = (0.2659 &#215; PICSAR expression) + (0.4374 &#215; FOXD2-AS1 expression) + (-0.3467 &#215; AP001065.1 expression). The CupRLSig high-risk group was associated with poor overall survival (hazard ratio = 1.162, 95%CI = 1.063-1.270; P < 0.001) after the patients were divided into two groups depending upon their median risk score. Model accuracy was further supported by receiver operating characteristic and principal component analysis as well as the validation set. The area under the curve of 0.741 was found to be a better predictor of HCC prognosis as compared to other clinicopathological variables. Mutation analysis revealed that high-risk combinations with high TMB carried worse prognoses (median survival of 30 mo vs 102 mo of low-risk combinations with low TMB group). The low-risk group had more activated natural killer cells (NK cells, P = 0.032 by Wilcoxon rank sum test) and fewer regulatory T cells (Tregs, P = 0.021) infiltration than the high-risk group. This finding could explain why the low-risk group has a better prognosis. Interestingly, when checkpoint gene expression (CD276, CTLA-4, and PDCD-1) and tumor immune dysfunction and rejection (TIDE) scores are considered, high-risk patients may respond better to immunotherapy. Finally, most drugs commonly used in preclinical and clinical systemic therapy for HCC, such as 5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, imatinib, sunitinib, rapamycin, and XL-184 (cabozantinib), were found to be more efficacious in the low-risk group; erlotinib, an exception, was more efficacious in the high-risk group. The lncRNA signature, CupRLSig, constructed in this study is valuable in prognostic estimation of HCC. Importantly, CupRLSig also predicts the level of immune infiltration and potential efficacy of tumor immunotherapy. ",

To investigate whether and how IL-34 affects the proliferation of GC cells and EMT. Using immunohistochemical staining, the expression of IL-34 protein was detected in 60 paired GC and normal paracancerous tissues and the relationship between IL-34 and clinicopathological factors was analyzed. The expression of IL-34 mRNA and protein in normal gastric epithelial cell lines and GC was detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting, respectively. Stable IL-34 knockdown and overexpression in AGS cell lines were established by lentiviral infection and validated by qRT-PCR and western blotting. The cholecystokinin-8 assay, clone formation assay, cell scratch assay, and transwell system were used to detect GC cell proliferation, clone formation, migration, and invasion capacity, respectively. The effects of IL-34 on the growth of GC transplant tumors were assessed using a subcutaneous transplant tumor assay in nude mice. The effects of IL-34 on the expression level of EMT-associated proteins in AGS cells were examined by western blotting. Expression of IL-34 protein and mRNA was higher in GC cell lines than in GES-1 cells. Compared to matched normal paraneoplastic tissues, the expression of IL-34 protein was higher in 60 GC tissues, which was correlated with tumor size, T-stage, N-stage, tumor, node and metastasis stage, and degree of differentiation. Knockdown of IL-34 expression inhibited the proliferation, clone formation, migration, and invasion of AGS cells, while overexpression of IL-34 promoted cell proliferation, clone formation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, the reduction of IL-34 promoted the expression of E-cadherin in AGS cells but inhibited the expression of vimentin and N-cadherin. Overexpression of IL-34 inhibited E-cadherin expression but promoted expression of vimentin and N-cadherin in AGS cells. Overexpression of IL-34 promoted the growth of subcutaneous transplanted tumors in nude mice. IL-34 expression is increased in GC tissues and cell lines compared to normal gastric tissues or cell lines. In GC cells, IL-34 promoted proliferation, clone formation, migration, and invasion by regulating EMT-related protein expression cells.

In addition, some scholars found that EAF2 frameshift mutations are associated with intratumor heterogeneity in colorectal cancer (CRC) and inactivation of EAF2 in microsatellite instability-high CRC. However, the molecular mechanism by which EAF2 is involved in CRC invasion and metastasis remains unclear. To determine the clinical value of expression of EAF2 protein in CRC, and to study the effects of EAF2 on the invasion, migration, and angiogenesis of CRC cells in vitro. In this study, we collected colorectal adenocarcinoma and corresponding adjacent tissues to investigate the clinical expression of EAF2 protein in patients with advanced CRC. Subsequently, we investigated the effect of EAF2 on the invasion, migration, and angiogenesis of CRC cells in vitro using plasmid transfection. EAF2 protein was lowly expressed in cancer tissues of patients with advanced CRC. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the survival rate of the high EAF2 level group was higher than that of the low EAF2 level group.

We speculated that the reason for this phenomenon could be that some prognostic factors had proven to be adverse through upfront surgery curative patterns, but some of them were not regarded as independent baseline characteristics, which is important to obtaining comparability between the NAT and upfront surgery groups. This fact could cause bias and lead to the difference in the outcomes of RCTs. In this review, we collate data about risk factors (such as tumor size, resection margin, and lymph node status) influencing the prognoses of patients with R-PA from five RCTs and discuss the possible reasons for the varying outcomes.

        "AbstractText": "Cancer incidence and mortality are increasing globally, leading to its rising status as a leading cause of death. The Go-Ichi-Ni-San (GINS) complex plays a crucial role in DNA replication and the cell cycle. The GINS complex consists of four subunits encoded by the GINS1, GINS2, GINS3, and GINS4 genes. Recent findings have shown that GINS2 expression is upregulated in many diseases, particularly tumors. For example, increased GINS2 expression has been found in cervical cancer, gastric adenocarcinoma, glioma, non-small cell lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer. It correlates with the clinicopathological characteristics of the tumors. In addition, high GINS2 expression plays a pro-carcinogenic role in tumor development by promoting tumor cell proliferation and migration, inhibiting tumor cell apoptosis, and blocking the cell cycle. This review describes the upregulation of GINS2 expression in most human tumors and the pathway of GINS2 in tumor development. GINS2 may serve as a new marker for tumor diagnosis and a new biological target for therapy. ",

        "AbstractText": "Multiple classes of molecular biomarkers have been studied as potential predictors for rectal cancer (RC) response. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is the most widely used blood-based marker of RC and has proven to be an effective predictive marker. Cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) is another tumor biomarker used for RC diagnosis and postoperative monitoring, as well as monitoring of the therapeutic effect. Using a panel of tumor markers for RC outcome prediction is a practical approach. To assess the predictive effect of pre-neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) CEA and CA19-9 levels on the prognosis of stage II/III RC patients. CEA and CA19-9 levels were evaluated 1 wk before NCRT. According to the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the optimal cut-off point of CEA and CA19-9 levels for the prognosis were 3.55 and 19.01, respectively. The novel serum tumor biomarker (NSTB) scores were as follows: score 0: Pre-NCRT CEA < 3.55 and CA19-9 < 19.01; score 2: Pre-NCRT CEA > 3.55 and CA19-9 > 19.01; score 1: Other situations. Pathological information was recorded according to histopathological reports after the operation. In the univariate analysis, pre-NCRT CEA < 3.55 [P = 0.025 for overall survival (OS), P = 0.019 for disease-free survival (DFS)], pre-NCRT CA19-9 < 19.01 (P = 0.014 for OS, P = 0.009 for DFS), a lower NSTB score (0-1 vs 2, P = 0.009 for OS, P = 0.005 for DFS) could predict a better prognosis. However, in the multivariate analysis, only a lower NSTB score (0-1 vs 2; for OS, HR = 0.485, 95%CI: 0.251-0.940, P = 0.032; for DFS, HR = 0.453, 95%CI: 0.234-0.877, P = 0.019) and higher pathological grade, node and metastasis stage (0-I vs II-III; for OS, HR = 0.363, 95%CI: 0.158-0.837, P = 0.017; for DFS, HR = 0.342, 95%CI: 0.149-0.786, P = 0.012) were independent predictive factors. The combination of post-NCRT CEA and CA19-9 was a predictive factor for clinical stage II/III RC patients receiving NCRT, and the combined index had a stronger predictive effect. ",

        "AbstractText": "Disseminated carcinomatosis of the bone marrow (DCBM) is a widespread metastasis with a hematologic disorder that is mainly caused by gastric cancer. Although it commonly occurs as a manifestation of recurrence long after curative treatment, the precise mechanism of relapse from dormant status remains unclear. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) can promote cancer progression and invasion in various cancers. However, the potential of G-CSF to trigger recurrence from a cured malignancy has not been reported. A 55-year-old Japanese woman was diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma localized on the fifth lumbar vertebrae 6 years after curative gastrectomy for T1 gastric cancer. After palliative surgery to release nerve compression, pathological diagnosis of the resected specimen was followed by curative radiation and chemotherapy. During treatment, G-CSF was administered 32 times for severe neutropenia prophylaxis. Eight months after completing definitive treatment, she complained of severe back pain and was diagnosed as multiple bone metastases with DCBM from gastric cancer. Despite palliative chemotherapy, she died of disseminated intravascular coagulation 13 d after the diagnosis. Immunohistochemical examination of the autopsied bone marrow confirmed a diffuse positive staining for the G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) in the relapsed gastric cancer cell cytoplasm, whereas the primary lesion cancer cells showed negative staining for G-CSFR. In this case, G-CSF administration may have been the key trigger for the disseminated relapse of a dormant gastric cancer. When administering G-CSF to cancer survivors, recurrence of a preceding cancer should be monitored even after curative treatment. ",

Early diagnosis is essential for improving the prognosis and survival rate of GC patients. Ring finger protein 180 (RNF180) is involved in the regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis, and aberrant hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter is strongly associated with the occurrence and development of GC. Thus, methylated RNF180 can be used as a potential biomarker for GC diagnosis. To use droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) to quantify the methylation level of the RN180 gene. A reproducible ddPCR assay to detect methylated RNF180 from trace DNA was designed and optimized. The primer and probe were designed and selected, the conversion time of bisulfite was optimized, the ddPCR system was adjusted by primer concentration, amplification temperature and amplification cycles, and the detection limit of ddPCR was determined. The best conversion time for blood DNA was 2 h 10 min, and that for plasma DNA was 2 h 10 min and 2 h 30 min. The results of ddPCR were better when the amplification temperature was 56 &#176;C and the number of amplification cycles was 50. Primer concentrations showed little effect on the assay outcome. Therefore, the primer concentration could be adjusted according to the reaction system and DNA input. The assay required at least 0.1 ng of input DNA. In summary, a ddPCR assay was established to detect methylated RNF180, which is expected to be a new diagnostic biomarker for GC. ",

Data from patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who underwent total mesorectal excision after short-course radiotherapy at Beijing Cancer Hospital between May 2002 and October 2005 were collected. A total of 151 tissue samples of rectal cancer were obtained using rigid proctoscopy before neoadjuvant radiotherapy, followed by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridisation to determine the patients' HER2 expression status. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the associations between the clinicopathological factors and HER2 status were performed. Survival was estimated and compared using the Kaplan-Meier method based on HER2 expression status, and the differences between groups were verified using the log-rank test. A total of 151 patients were enrolled in this study. A total of 27 (17.9%) patients were ultimately confirmed to be HER2-positive. The follow-up duration ranged from 9 mo to 210 mo, with a median of 134 mo. Distant metastasis and local recurrence occurred in 60 (39.7%) and 24 (15.9%) patients, respectively. HER2 positivity was significantly associated with the pre-treatment lymph node stage (pre-N) (P = 0.040), while there were no differences between HER2 status and age, sex, preoperative CEA levels (pre-CEA), T stage, and lympho-vascular invasion. In terms of prognosis, HER2 overexpression was correlated with distant metastasis (P = 0.002) rather than local recurrence (P > 0.05). The multivariate analysis demonstrated that elevated pre-CEA [P = 0.002, odds ratio (OR) = 3.277, 97.5% confidence interval (CI): 1.543-7.163], post N(+) (P = 0.022, OR = 2.437, 97.5%CI: 1.143-5.308) and HER2(+) (P = 0.003, OR = 4.222, 97.5%CI: 1.667-11.409) were risk factors for distant metastasis. The survival analysis showed that there were significant differences between rectal cancer patients in terms of disease-free survival (DFS) [hazard ratio: 1.69 (95%CI: 0.91-3.14); P = 0.048] and overall survival (OS) [1.95 (1.05-3.63); P = 0.0077].

To investigate the expression and potential mechanism of action of VCAN in HCC. Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma dataset, we explored the correlation between VCAN expression and clinical features, and analyzed the prognosis of patients with high and low VCAN expression. The potential mechanism of action of VCAN was explored by Gene Ontology analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis, and gene set enrichment analysis. We also explored immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint gene expression, and sensitivity of immune checkpoint [programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4)] inhibitor therapy in patients with different VCAN expression. VCAN mRNA expression and VCAN methylation in peripheral blood were tested in 100 hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related patients (50 HCC and 50 liver cirrhosis). VCAN was highly expressed in HCC tissues, which was associated with a poor prognosis in HCC patients. No significant difference was found in VCAN mRNA expression in blood between patients with HBV-related cirrhosis and those with HCC, but there was a significant difference in VCAN methylation between the two groups. The correlation between VCAN and infiltrations of several different tumor immune cell types (including B cells, CD8+ T cells, and eosinophils) was significantly different. VCAN was strongly related to immune checkpoint gene expression and tumor mutation burden, and could be a biomarker of sensitivity to immune checkpoint (PD1/CTLA4) inhibitors. In addition, VCAN mRNA expression was associated with hepatitis B e antigen, HBV DNA, white blood cells, platelets, cholesterol, and coagulation function. High VCAN level could be a possible biomarker for poor prognosis of HCC, and its immunomodulatory mechanism in HCC warrants investigation. ",

Given the morbidity of recurrent treatment, systemic therapy to reduce or eliminate the need for surgery has been long-awaited. Herein, we sought to gain insight about future utilization by surveying VHL kidney cancer experts in the United States. A survey developed by members of the VHL Alliance (VHLA) Clinical Advisory Council was distributed to kidney cancer providers at VHLA and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) centers. Surveys were administered on a secure web-based platform. A total of 60 respondents from 29 institutions participated. Urologists (50%) and medical oncologists (43%) represented the majority of participants. The majority (98%) of respondents anticipated that belzutifan's approval would significantly change the current treatment landscape. Most reported that therapy should be continuous (76%). There was a difference in willingness to prescribe belzutifan by specialty (38% of urologists vs 91% of medical oncologists (P = 0.02)). In individuals with renal tumors <3 cm, 36% would still recommend surveillance, while 36% would initiate belzutifan to prevent growth. In those with multifocal renal lesions and growth of a solitary tumor on belzutifan, 50% would proceed with only treatment of that site. In conclusion, VHL kidney cancer specialists anticipate a paradigm shift with the approval of belzutifan. Provider roles may change with movement away from surgical management. Opinions on treatment indications, such as when to initiate therapy and how to best salvage, vary widely and therefore collaborative efforts among experts may assist in the development of new clinical guidelines.

Four adult Yucatan minipigs were subjected twice to four acute EA treatments (25-minute acute sessions) including sham (false acupoints) and control (no EA), during anesthesia and according to a Latin-square design paradigm. Acupoint combinations (4 loci each) are head-abdomen (#70 Dafengmen, #35 Sanwan), back (bilateral #27 Pishu, #28 Weishu), leg (bilateral #79 Hangou, #63 Housanli), and sham (2 bilateral points that are not acupoints). Electrocardiograms were performed to explore heart rate variability (HRV). Infrared thermography was used to measure skin temperature at the stimulation points. Saliva (cortisol) and blood samples (leptin, total/active ghrelin, insulin, and glucose) were collected for further analyses before and after acute EA. All animals were also subjected to BOLD fMRI to investigate the brain responses to EA. Acute EA significantly modulated several physiological and metabolic parameters compared to basal, sham, and/or control conditions, with contrasting effects in terms of BOLD responses in brain regions involved in the hedonic and cognitive control of food intake. The head-abdomen combination appeared to be the most promising combination in terms of brain modulation of the corticostriatal circuit, with upregulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsal striatum, and anterior cingulate cortex. It also induced significantly lower plasma ghrelin levels compared to sham, suggesting anorectic effects, as well as no temperature drop at the stimulation site.

In our established workflow we combine targeted isotopologue feature extraction with the non-targeted X13CMS routine. Metabolites, detected by X13CMS as differentially labeled between two biological conditions are subsequently integrated into the original targeted library. This strategy enables monitoring of changes in known pathways as well as the discovery of hitherto unknown metabolic alterations. Here, we demonstrate this workflow in a PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) null breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-468) exploring metabolic pathway activities in the absence and presence of the selective PI3K&#946; inhibitor AZD8186. Cells were fed with [U-13C] glucose and treated for 1, 3, 6, and 24&#160;h with 0.5&#160;&#181;M AZD8186 or vehicle, extracted by an optimized sample preparation protocol and analyzed by LC-QTOF-MS. Untargeted differential tracing of labels revealed 286 isotope-enriched features that were significantly altered between control and treatment conditions, of which 19 features could be attributed to known compounds from targeted pathways. Other 11 features were unambiguously identified based on data-dependent MS/MS spectra and reference substances. Notably, only a minority of the significantly altered features (11 and 16, respectively) were identified when preprocessing of the same data set (treatment vs. control in 24&#160;h unlabeled samples) was performed with tools commonly used for label-free (i.e. w/o isotopic tracer) non-targeted metabolomics experiments (Profinder&#180;s batch recursive feature extraction and XCMS). The structurally identified metabolites were integrated into the existing targeted isotopologue feature extraction workflow to enable natural abundance correction, evaluation of assay performance and assessment of drug-induced changes in pathway activities. Label incorporation was highly reproducible for the majority of isotopologues in technical replicates with a RSD below 10%. Furthermore, inter-day repeatability of a second label experiment showed strong correlation (Pearson R 2 > 0.99) between tracer incorporation on different days. Finally, we could identify prominent pathway activity alterations upon PI3K&#946; inhibition. Besides pathways in central metabolism, known to be changed our workflow revealed additional pathways, like pyrimidine metabolism or hexosamine pathway.

However, clinical trials with low response rates have been disappointing for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). One suggested explanation is the accumulation of dominantly immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Using retrospectively collected tumor specimens and transcriptomic data from PDAC, we demonstrate that expression of the scavenger receptor MARCO correlates with poor prognosis and a lymphocyte-excluding tumor phenotype. PDAC cell lines produce IL-10 and induce high expression of MARCO in myeloid cells, and this was further enhanced during hypoxic conditions. These myeloid cells suppressed effector T and natural killer (NK) cells and blocked NK cell tumor infiltration and tumor killing in a PDAC 3D-spheroid model. Anti-human MARCO (anti-hMARCO) antibody targeting triggered the repolarization of tumor-associated macrophages and activated the inflammasome machinery, resulting in IL-18 production. This in turn enhanced T&#160;cell and NK cell functions. The targeting of MARCO thus remodels the TME and represents a rational approach to make immunotherapy more efficient in PDAC patients. ",

        "AbstractText": "In recent years, the synergistic effect of photothermal therapy (PTT) and chemotherapy has been recognized as an effective strategy for cancer treatment. Controlling the PTT temperature and drug release profile is desirable for minimizing the unexpected damage to normal cells. In this study, a smart platform of stepwise PTT and chemotherapy has been developed by using composite porous scaffolds of biodegradable black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets, gold nanorods(AuNRs), doxorubicin (Dox)-encapsulated thermosensitive liposomes and biodegradable polymers. Under near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, the composite scaffolds could attain high and low local temperatures before and after BP degradation, respectively. Dox release from the composite scaffolds could be controlled by the temperature change. In vitro cell culture and in vivo animal experiments indicated that a strong synergistic effect of PTT and chemotherapy could be achieved at an early stage of treatment before BP degradation, and a mild hyperthermia effect was shown for chemotherapy in the late stage after BP degradation. Moreover, the composite scaffolds after the complete release of Dox could support the proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells. The composite scaffolds showed a synergistic effect of stepwise PTT and chemotherapy for breast cancer elimination and promoted stem cell activities after killing cancer cells. ",

        "ArticleTitle": "Overexpression of Copines-1 is associated with clinicopathological parameters and poor outcome in gastric cancer. ",
        "AbstractText": "Copines-1 (CPNE1) is a soluble membrane-binding protein that includes two tandem C2 domains at the N-terminus and a C terminal A domain. Importantly, it is associated with the prognosis of various tumors, but there are only a few studies regarding the role of CPNE1 in gastric cancer (GC). This study aimed to explore the clinicopathological significance and prognostic potential of CPNE1 expression in GC. Data from the TIMER2.0 and UALCAN were analyzed to assess CPNE1 mRNA levels in GC. The prognostic role of CPNE1 mRNA was examined via the Kaplan-Meier plotter. CPNE1 protein expression in tumor tissues was analyzed via immunohistochemistry of clinical samples from 99 GC patients. The relationship of CPNE1 expression with clinicopathological parameters and overall survival (OS) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Copines-1 mRNA levels were higher in GC tissues than in adjacent normal tissue (ANT) (p&#160;<&#8201;0.05). Further, high CPNE1 mRNA expression indicated poor OS (p&#160;=&#8201;9.4&#8201;e-10) and was significantly associated with first progression (FP) (p&#160;=&#8201;1.6&#8201;e-06) and post-progression survival (PPS) (p&#160;=&#8201;1.5&#8201;e-12). In addition, CPNE1 protein expression was higher in GC tissues than in ANT (p&#160;<&#8201;0.0001). Moreover, CPNE1 high expression was significantly related to advanced tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage (p&#160;=&#8201;0.004), lymph node metastasis (p&#160;=&#8201;0.003), and vascular invasion (p&#160;=&#8201;0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that GC patients with high expression CPNE1 group had worse OS than low expression group (p&#160;=&#8201;0.003). Univariate analysis showed that age (hazard ratio [HR]&#160;=&#160;1.992; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.009-3.934; p&#160;=&#8201;0.047), advanced TNM stage (HR&#160;=&#160;4.941; 95% CI, 2.052-11.897; p&#160;=&#8201;0.000), tumor invasion (HR&#160;=&#160;3.472; 95% CI, 1.349-8.937; p&#160;=&#8201;0.010), lymph node metastasis (HR&#160;=&#160;8.846; 95% CI, 2.708-28.897; p&#160;=&#8201;0.000), vascular invasion (HR&#160;=&#160;3.237; 95% CI, 1.521-6.891; p&#160;=&#8201;0.002), nervous invasion (HR&#160;=&#160;2.324; 95% CI, 1.205-4.479; p&#160;=&#8201;0.012), and CPNE1 expression (HR&#160;=&#160;3.464; 95% CI, 1.440-8.334; p&#160;=&#8201;0.006) were correlated with OS. In the multivariate analysis, age (HR&#160;=&#160;2.514; 95% CI, 1.264-4.999; p&#160;=&#8201;0.009), lymph node metastasis (HR&#160;=&#160;8.441; 95% CI, 2.553-27.906; p&#160;<&#8201;0.05), and CPNE1 expression (HR&#160;=&#160;2.549; 95% CI, 1.051-6.186; p&#160;=&#8201;0.039) were significant prognostic predictors for GC. Copines-1 overexpression in GC is significantly associated with poor prognosis. Thus, CPNE1 levels may serve as a prognostic biomarker in GC patients. ",

        "AbstractText": "The long non-coding RNA Growth-arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) has been extensively linked with the ability of cancer cells to resist chemotherapeutic interventions. This prospective study aimed to investigate the role of GAS5 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), which has been poorly characterized to date. GAS5 and miR-196a expression levels were detected by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Cisplatin (DDP) sensitivity and apoptosis levels were determined using Cell Counting Kit 8 and flow cytometry, respectively. Luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays were performed to confirm target miRNAs of GAS5. We found that GAS5 was expressed at low levels in DDP-resistant OSCC cell lines and tissues, and that GAS5 levels were intricately linked to the survival rates of OSCC patients. GAS5 overexpression led to the recovery of DDP sensitivity in CAL27/DDP cells. Additionally, in both DDP-resistant and -sensitive lines, GAS5 showed a cytoplasmic distribution and downregulated miR-196a in OSCC tissues. Exogenous transfection of miR-196a alleviated the effects of GAS5 on DDP sensitivity, confirming this as the mechanism of chemoresistance. These findings may provide new targets for the treatment of chemotherapy-resistant OSCC. ",

        "AbstractText": "Background: Palbociclib is the most widely used cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor in China, but its early application efficacy on Chinese metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients was reported deficiently. Methods: Between February 2019 to December 2021, 95 female hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HER2-) patients with MBC received palbociclib combined with AI or fulvestrant were retrospectively analyzed in our center. The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS). The objective response rate and clinical benefit rate (CBR) were evaluated. Results: The median follow-up period was 15 months (range from 2 to 37). Palbociclib performed superiorly when applicated in first-and-second line therapy than in later lines (P&#8201;&#8201;=&#8201;&#8201;.002). Palbociclib combined with AI or fulvestrant had a median PFS of 34 months (95% confidence interval [CI]&#8201;&#8201;=&#8201;&#8201;6.87-61.13) and 12 months (95%CI&#8201;&#8201;=&#8201;&#8201;7.76-16.24), respectively. Univariate subgroup analysis showed that the previous history of salvage chemotherapy (P&#8201;&#8201;=&#8201;&#8201;.015) and the presence of liver metastases (P&#8201;<&#8201;.001) significantly affected the efficacy of palbociclib. Despite the existence of liver metastases and primary endocrine resistance, which are two independent predictors of poor prognosis, early application of palbociclib in advanced stage can bring further benefits to these two groups of patients, rather than choosing salvage chemotherapy in the first place. Conclusion: Palbociclib combined with endocrine therapy has a favorable efficacy and acceptable toxicity in HR+/HER2- Chinese MBC patients. Better performance can be seen when palbociclib was applicated in the early stage. ",

We report a case of uterine leiomyosarcoma with extensive perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa)-like areas and extrauterine metastases. The patient was a 49-year-old gravida 3 para 2 Japanese woman with no relevant medical history. She noticed a vaginal mass with bleeding. Imaging examination revealed a uterine tumor and multiple liver and lung metastases. The vaginal tumor (3.5&#8197;cm) was resected and diagnosed as a malignant PEComa based on morphology and myomelanocytic marker expression. Clinically used targeted sequencing (FoundationOneCDx&#8482;) revealed gene alterations in RB1, TP53, and ATRX but not TSC1/2. Despite administration of an mTOR inhibitor, the tumor size increased, and subsequently, hysterectomy was performed to relieve the symptoms. The uterine tumor was composed of conventional leiomyosarcoma showing RB1 loss, wild-type TP53 staining, and retained ATRX expression, as well as adjacent predominant PEComa-like components with RB1 loss, TP53 overexpression, and ATRX loss, identical to the characteristics of the vaginal tumor. In the uterine tumor, both HMB-45 and MITF were weak to moderately positive for approximately 40% of tumor cells while Melan-A was negative. The tumor was finally diagnosed as leiomyosarcoma with PEComa-like features. This case exemplifies the tumorigenesis of diagnostically challenging tumors with myomelanocytic differentiation and demonstrates the importance of integrating multiple types of information, including genomic profiling, in making a correct diagnosis leading to appropriate treatment.

        "AbstractText": "Cancer is frequently associated with the appearance of cachexia, a multifactorial wasting syndrome. Cachexia develops either as a result of tumor progression or as a side effect of anticancer treatments, especially of standard chemotherapy, eventually representing the direct cause of death in up to one third of all cancer patients. Cachexia, within its multi-organ affection, is characterized by severe loss of muscle mass and function, representing the most relevant subject of preclinical and clinical investigation. The pathogenesis of muscle wasting in cancer- and chemotherapy-induced cachexia is complex and encompasses heightened protein catabolism and reduced anabolism, disrupted mitochondria and energy metabolism and even neuromuscular junction dismantling. The mechanisms underlying these alterations are still controversial, especially concerning the molecular drivers that could be targeted for anti-cachexia therapies. Inflammation and mitochondrial oxidative stress are among the principal candidates, the latter being extensively discussed in the present review. Several approaches have been tested in order to modulate the redox homeostasis in tumor hosts and to counteract cancer- and chemotherapy-induced muscle wasting, from exercise training to distinct classes of direct or indirect antioxidants. We herein report the most relevant results obtained in both preclinical and clinical trials. Including the assessment and the treatment of altered redox balance in the clinical management of cancer patients is still a big challenge. The available evidence suggests that fortifying the antioxidant defenses either by pharmacological or non-pharmacological strategies will likely improve cachexia and eventually the outcome of a broad cancer patient population.

Men &#8805;45 years of age with biopsy confirmed unilateral Gleason Grade Group 2 (GGG2) adenocarcinoma of the prostate, prostate volume 20-80 cc, and PSA &#8804;15 ng/mL were enrolled. Cystoscopy and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guidance were used to deliver ~103&#176;C water vapor to prostate zones for unilateral hemi-gland ablation including destruction of cancers suspected by mpMRI and confirmed by biopsy. The primary outcome was device-related serious adverse events (SAEs). At 7 days and 6 months post-procedure, ablation extent was assessed by mpMRI; MRI/TRUS fusion biopsies were completed at 6 months. Quality of life (QOL) was assessed with validated questionnaires. At baseline 8/15 subjects had positive biopsy cores of GGG1 cancer on the targeted treatment side. All subjects successfully underwent a single hemi-gland TUVA procedure. No SAEs occurred. Grade 2 procedure-related AEs included transient urinary retention (n=4) and erectile (n=1) or ejaculatory dysfunction (n=1).

        "AbstractText": "Online adaptive radiotherapy (ART) requires accurate and efficient&#160;auto-segmentation of target volumes and organs-at-risk (OARs) in mostly cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images, which often have severe artifacts and lack soft tissue contrast, making direct segmentation very challenging. Propagating expert-drawn contours from the pre-treatment planning CT (pCT) through traditional or deep learning (DL) based deformable image registration (DIR) can achieve improved results in many situations. Typical DL-based DIR models are population-based, that is, trained with a dataset for a population of patients, and so they may be affected by the generalizability problem. In this paper, we propose a method called test-time optimization (TTO) to refine a pre-trained DL-based DIR population model, first for each individual test patient, and then progressively for each fraction of online ART treatment. Our proposed method is less susceptible to the generalizability problem, and thus can improve overall performance of different DL-based DIR models by improving model accuracy, especially for outliers. Our experiments used data from 239 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma to test the proposed method. Firstly, we trained a population model with 200 patients, and then applied TTO to the remaining 39 test patients by refining the trained population model to obtain 39 individualized models. We compared each of the individualized models with the population model in terms of segmentation accuracy. The average improvement of the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of segmentation can be up to 0.04 (5%) and 0.98 mm (25%), respectively, with the individualized models compared to the population model over 17 selected OARs and a target of 39 patients. While the average improvement may seem mild, we found that the improvement for outlier patients with structures of large anatomical changes is significant. The number of patients with at least 0.05 DSC improvement or 2 mm HD95 improvement by TTO averaged over the 17 selected structures for the state-of-the-art architecture Voxelmorph, is 10 out of 39 test patients. By deriving the individualized model using TTO from the pre-trained population model, TTO models can be ready in about one minute. We also generated the adapted fractional models for each of the 39 test patients by progressively refining the individualized models using TTO to CBCT images acquired at later fractions of online ART treatment. When adapting the individualized model to a later fraction of the same patient, the model can be ready in less than a minute with slightly improved accuracy. The proposed TTO method is well-suited for online ART and can boost segmentation accuracy for DL-based DIR models, especially for outlier patients where the pre-trained models fail.

Recently, it was found that a class of sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) expressed on the surface of T cells in cancer patients inhibit T cell activation through their intracellular immunosuppressive motifs by recognizing sialic acid-carrying glycans, sialoglycans. However, ligands of Siglecs remain elusive. Here, we reported sialylated-IgG (SIA-IgG), a ligand to Siglec-7, that is highly expressed in epithelial cancer cells. SIA-IgG binds Siglec-7 directly and inhibits TCR signals. Blocking of either SIA-IgG or Siglec-7 elicited potent antitumor immunity in T cells.

We aimed to explore a novel molecular mechanism underlying the chemosensitivity of HCC to SFN, and to identify a promising therapeutic target for HCC treatment. In this study, bioinformatic analysis revealed that DDX24 was associated with poor survival in HCC cases, and significantly related to the pathways modulating tumor development. DDX24 regulated HCC cell proliferation and migration potentials. Moreover, reduction of DDX24 promoted the sorafenib-mediated inhibition of HCC cell growth and migration, the elevation of sorafenib-induced HCC cell apoptosis. DDX24 overexpression suppressed the inhibitory effect of SFN on cell proliferation and migration and reduced the apoptosis induced by SFN. Further, DDX24, combined with SFN treatment, presented a synergistic enhancement of the sensitivity of SFN to the growth and migration of HCC cells via AKT/ERK and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathways, and that it modulated apoptosis via the caspase/PARP pathway. Mechanistically, SNORA18 served as a target gene for DDX24, regulating the chemosensitivity of sorafenib-treated HCC cells. Furthermore, SNORA18 knockdown or overexpression could partially reverse the inhibition or elevation of cell viability, colony formation and migration induced by DDX24 in sorafenib-treated HCC cells, respectively. Collectively, our results suggest that DDX24 regulates the chemosensitivity of HCC to SFN by mediating the expression of SNORA18, which may act as an effective therapeutic target for improving SFN efficiency in HCC treatment.

        "AbstractText": "TERF2/TRF2 is a pleiotropic telomeric protein that plays a crucial role in tumor formation and progression through several telomere-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Here, we uncovered a novel function for this protein in regulating the macroautophagic/autophagic process upon different stimuli. By using both biochemical and cell biology approaches, we found that TERF2 binds to the non-histone chromatin-associated protein HMGB1, and this interaction is functional to the nuclear/cytoplasmic protein localization. Specifically, silencing of TERF2 alters the redox status of the cells, further exacerbated upon EBSS nutrient starvation, promoting the cytosolic translocation and the autophagic activity of HMGB1. Conversely, overexpression of wild-type TERF2, but not the mutant unable to bind HMGB1, negatively affects the cytosolic translocation of HMGB1, counteracting the stimulatory effect of EBSS starvation. Moreover, genetic depletion of HMGB1 or treatment with inflachromene, a specific inhibitor of its cytosolic translocation, completely abolished the pro-autophagic activity of TERF2 silencing. In conclusion, our data highlighted a novel mechanism through which TERF2 modulates the autophagic process, thus demonstrating the key role of the telomeric protein in regulating a process that is fundamental, under both physiological and pathological conditions, in defining the fate of the cells.Abbreviations: ALs: autolysosomes; ALT: alternative lengthening of telomeres; ATG: autophagy related; ATM: ATM serine/threonine kinase; CQ: Chloroquine; DCFDA: 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate; DDR: DNA damage response; DHE: dihydroethidium; EBSS: Earle's balanced salt solution; FACS: fluorescence-activated cell sorting; GFP: green fluorescent protein; EGFP: enhanced green fluorescent protein; GSH: reduced glutathione; GSSG: oxidized glutathione; HMGB1: high mobility group box 1; ICM: inflachromene; IF: immunofluorescence; IP: immunoprecipitation; NAC: N-acetyl-L-cysteine; NHEJ: non-homologous end joining; PLA: proximity ligation assay; RFP: red fluorescent protein; ROS: reactive oxygen species; TIF: telomere-induced foci; TERF2/TRF2: telomeric repeat binding factor 2.

The malignant GBM cell line (U87) was examined for apoptosis rate, cell cycle analysis, cell viability, mRNA expressions of several apoptotic and metastasis-associated genes, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), MMP-2, and MMP-9 activity and protein expression, and migration ability. The findings revealed that UB decreased U87 GBM viability in a dose-dependent manner and NIH/3T3 normal cells with the IC50 value of 30 and 55&#160;&#956;M after 24&#8201;h, respectively. UB also induces necrosis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in U87 cells. UB also increases ROS production and caused down-regulation of Bcl2 and up-regulation of Bax apoptotic genes.

The inner layer, known as dermis, is constituted by connective tissue and different types of immune cells whereas the outer layer, the epidermis, is composed by different layers of keratinocytes and an abundant number of melanocytes, localized in the stratum basale of the epidermis. Oxidative stress is a common alteration of inflammatory skin disorders such as vitiligo, dermatitis, or psoriasis but can also play a causal role in skin carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) has emerged as a crucial regulator of cell defense mechanisms activating complex transcriptional programs that facilitate reactive oxygen species detoxification, repair oxidative damage and prevent xenobiotic-induced toxicity.

        "AbstractText": "Bacterial L-asparaginases have been used for over 40&#8201;years as anticancer drugs. Ardalan et al. (Medical Hypotheses 112, 7-17, 2018) proposed that the V27T mutant of Escherichia coli type II L-asparaginase, EcAII(V27T), should display altered biophysical and catalytic properties compared to the wild-type enzyme, EcAII(wt), rendering it more favorable as a pharmaceutical. They postulated that EcAII(V27T) would exhibit reduced glutaminolytic activity and be more stable compared to EcAII(wt). Their postulates, however, were purely theoretical. Here, we characterized experimentally selected properties of EcAII(V27T). We found asparaginolytic activity of this mutant unchanged, whereas its glutaminolytic activity was four-fold lower compared to EcAII(wt). We did not observe significant differences in stabilities of EcAII(wt) and EcAII(V27T). Crystal structures of the complexes with L-Asp and L-Glu showed considerable differences in binding modes of both substrates. ",

        "AbstractText": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer with a poor prognosis, lacking therapeutic targets. miRNAs play crucial roles in TNBC through regulating various mechanisms, including cellular growth and proliferation. This study aims to identify critical target genes of two novel miRNAs (miR-3143 and miR-3182) involved in the cell cycle of TNBC as possible therapeutic targets and investigates their regulatory and therapeutic roles through a systems biology approach and in-vitro experiment. Datasets related to the TNBC cell line (MDA-MB-231) were screened and retrieved, and Gene regulatory networks were constructed. Significant regulatory motifs were detected and analyzed using the FANMOD and Cytoscape analyzer, and the clusters and seeds were identified using the MCODE. Functional enrichment analysis was also performed using DAVID and STRING. The most critical genes were determined using the analysis of GRN motifs and PPI clusters. The essential genes involved in the cell cycle were selected and verified using the bc-GenExMiner v4.7. We overexpressed miR-3143 and miR-3182 in the MDA-MB-231 cell line using human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (HUCMSC)-miRNA loaded exosomes, and the expression of the critical target genes was investigated using RT-qPCR. We identified eight critical genes as potential therapeutic targets. Their expression decreased by overexpression of miR-3143 and miR-3182 in RT-qPCR. The identified critical genes have probably significant roles in the pathogenesis of TNBC through the cell cycle. We suggest that overexpression of miR-3143 and miR-3182 could be a new therapeutic candidate in TNBC and is worth more investigation. ",

        "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND We performed a case-control study and an updated meta-analysis to assess the relationship between the hOGG1 rs1052133 polymorphism and prostate cancer (PCa) risk. MATERIAL AND METHODS We recruited 160 PCa cases and 243 healthy controls. For the meta-analysis, relevant studies were recruited from diverse databases up to April 2022. Genetic risk was evaluated by using an odds ratio (OR) with a corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). The genotypes of this polymorphism were genotyped via the SNaPshot genotyping method. RESULTS In the case-control study, we failed to identify any association between the hOGG1 rs1052133 polymorphism and PCa risk. Negative results were also obtained when stratified analyses were performed based on the patient's prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) level and Gleason score, as well as tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) stage. To enlarge the sample size, we performed a restricted updated meta-analysis by recruiting 10 case-control studies (including the current one), and the results suggested that genotypes of rs1052133 polymorphism were significantly associated with an elevated risk of PCa in 2 genetic models - the heterozygote and dominant models. In the stratification analysis by population ethnicity, a significant association of this polymorphism with susceptibility to PCa was found both in the Asian populations and White populations. CONCLUSIONS Our case-control and updated meta-analysis study suggest that the hOGG1 rs1052133 polymorphism is a susceptibility factor for PCa, but still needs to be further verified in the Chinese population.

        "AbstractText": "Cancer has long been a hot research topic, and recent years have witnessed the incidence of cancer trending toward younger individuals with great socioeconomic burden. Even with surgery, therapeutic agents serve as the mainstay to combat cancer in the clinic. Intensive research on nanomaterials can overcome the shortcomings of conventional drug delivery approaches, such as the lack of selectivity for targeted regions, poor stability against degradation, and uncontrolled drug release behavior. Over the years, different types of drug carriers have been developed for cancer therapy. One of these is liposome-in-gel (LP-Gel), which has combined the merits of both liposomes and hydrogels, and has emerged as a versatile carrier for cancer therapy. LP-Gel hybrids have addressed the lack of stability of conventional liposomes against pH and ionic strength while displaying higher efficiency of delivery hydrophilic drugs as compared to conventional gels. They can be classified into three types according to their assembled structure, are characterized by their nontoxicity, biodegradability, and flexibility for clinical use, and can be mainly categorized based on their controlled release, transmucosal delivery, and transdermal delivery properties for anticancer therapy. This review covers the recent progress on the applications of LP-Gel hybrids for anticancer therapy. ",

        "AbstractText": "Aim of this study is to assess the repeatability of radiomic features on MRI images and their stability to variations in time of repetition (TR), time of echo (TE), slice thickness (ST) and pixel spacing (PS) using vegetable phantoms. The organic phantom was realized using two cucumbers placed inside a cylindrical container and the analysis was performed using T1-weighted (T1w), T2-weighted (T2w) and diffusion weighted images (DWIs). One dataset was used to test the repeatability of the radiomic features, while other four datasets were used to test the sensitivity of the different MRI sequences to image acquisition parameters (TR, TE, ST and PS). Four regions of interest (ROIs) were segmented: two for the central part of each cucumber and two for the external parts. Radiomic features were extracted from each ROI using Pyradiomics. To assess the effect of preprocessing on the reduction of variability, features were extracted both before and after the preprocessing. The coefficient of variation (CV) and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) were used to evaluate variability. The use of intensity standardization increased the stability for the first-order statistics features. Shape and size features were always stable for all the analyses. Textural features were particularly sensitive to changes in ST and PS, although some increase in stability could be obtained by voxel size resampling. When images underwent image preprocessing, the number of stable features (ICC > 0.75 and mean absolute CV < 0.3) was 33 for ADC, 52 for T1w and 73 for T2w. The most critical source of variability is related to changes in voxel size (either caused by changes in ST or PS). Preprocessing increases features stability to both test-retest and variation of the image acquisition parameters for all the types of analysed MRI (T1w, T2w and ADC), except for slice thickness.

All uveal melanoma patients born in Sweden between 1947 and 1990 were included (n&#8201;=&#8201;745). The latitude of patients' birthplaces and home counties at the time of uveal melanoma diagnosis were collected. For all latitudes, data on sunlight and UV intensity parameters, temperature, daytime length variations, and socioeconomic factors were added. The prognostic implication of birthplace latitude and of moving&#8201;>&#8201;1 degree of latitude was examined with multivariate Cox regressions and competing risk analyses. There were no significant differences in patient sex, age, tumor size, T-category, or BAP-1 immunoexpression between patients born in the south, central or northern regions of Sweden. Decreasing birthplace latitude was a predictor of uveal melanoma-related mortality in multivariate Cox regression. Patients that were born in southern regions or moved&#8201;>&#8201;1 degree south between birth and diagnosis had higher incidence of uveal melanoma-related mortality in competing risk analysis. The sum of yearly sunshine hours, global sunlight radiation, average daily ultraviolet light intensity, average annual temperature, or net wealth were not predictors of uveal melanoma-related mortality. Latitude is a prognostic factor in uveal melanoma. This does not seem to be related to variations in patient or tumor characteristics at presentation, in management, in sunlight intensity, in ultraviolet light irradiance, in temperature, or in wealth. Future studies should examine if periodical changes in daylight hours or other factors could explain the prognostic implication. ",

We reviewed 240 patients with cM0 NSCLC who underwent lobectomy. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) immunocytochemistry was performed with LBC to aid in the diagnosis of minimal MPE. We assessed the efficacy of this diagnostic method, relevant clinical factors, and postoperative outcomes. LBC showed positive results in two patients and suspicious results in 21. Of the 21 patients, immunocytochemistry showed minimal MPE in 10 (47.6%); therefore, a total of 12 patients (5%) showed minimal MPE. Minimal MPE is associated with an older age, increased consolidation tumor ratio, and adenocarcinoma histology. The 12 patients with minimal MPE had a 3-year overall survival rate of 90%. Postoperative recurrence was observed in seven patients (58.3%), four of whom were treated with epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors or immune checkpoint inhibitors, while three are still undergoing treatment, with a survival of 2.2, 2.5 and 5.5&#160;years.

        "AbstractText": "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an epithelia-derived malignancy with a distinctive geographic distribution. Cystathionine &#947;-lyase (CSE) is involved in cancer development and progression. Nevertheless, the role of CSE in the growth of NPC is unknown. In this study, we found that CSE levels in human NPC cells were higher than those in normal nasopharyngeal cells. CSE overexpression enhanced the proliferative, migrative, and invasive abilities of NPC cells and CSE downregulation exerted reverse effects. Overexpression of CSE decreased the expressions of cytochrome C, cleaved caspase (cas)-3, cleaved cas-9, and cleaved poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, whereas CSE knockdown exhibited reverse effects. CSE overexpression decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and the expressions of phospho (p)-extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2, p-c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p-p38, but promoted the expressions of p-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), p-AKT, and p-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), whereas CSE knockdown showed oppose effects. In addition, CSE overexpression promoted NPC xenograft tumor growth and CSE knockdown decreased tumor growth by modulating proliferation, angiogenesis, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Furthermore, DL-propargylglycine (an inhibitor of CSE) dose-dependently inhibited NPC cell growth via ROS-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways without significant toxicity. In conclusion, CSE could regulate the growth of NPC cells through ROS-mediated MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascades. CSE might be a novel tumor marker for the diagnosis and prognosis of NPC. Novel donors/drugs that inhibit the expression/activity of CSE can be developed in the treatment of NPC. ",

This retrospective study enrolled 250 surgical patients and 24 nonsurgical patients with sunitinib-based treatment in our hospital from 2008 to 2019. CT images were assessed, the maximum value was defined as \"CTmax,\" and recurrence-free survival (RFS) or progression-free survival (PFS) was compared between a high-CTmax group and a low-CTmax group among patients who underwent surgical resection or nonsurgical, sunitinib-based treatment according to the CTmax cutoff value. In ROC curve analysis, a CTmax of 108 Hounsfield units, as the cutoff value, achieved an AUC of 0.796 in predicting recurrence. Compared with the low-CTmax group, the high-CTmax group had a longer RFS (p < 0.001). Low CTmax was identified as an independent factor for RFS (p < 0.001) in multivariate analysis; these results were confirmed using the internal validation set. The CTmax value was significantly correlated with the microvascular density (MVD) value (p < 0.001) and the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) score (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the high-CTmax group had a better PFS than the low-CTmax group among the sunitinib treatment group (p = 0.007). The tumour CTmax on APCT might be a potential and independent indicator for predicting recurrence in patients who have undergone surgical resection and assessing the efficacy of sunitinib for patients with advanced metastatic pNETs.

All patients from 12 academic institutions who underwent CRS&#8201;&#177;&#8201;HIPEC for PSM from 2000 to 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. OS and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method while conditional overall (COS) and conditional disease-free survival (CDFS) rates were calculated at 1, 2, or 3&#160;years from surgery for different tumor histologies. Overall, 1610 patients underwent CRS&#8201;&#177;&#8201;HIPEC. Among patients with benign appendiceal mucinous tumors (N&#8201;=&#8201;460), 5-year OS and COS at 3&#160;years were 92.1% and 96.3% (&#916;4.2%), respectively.

Therapy decisions are guided in most cases independently of the histological subtype and are directed by biomarkers and tumor stage. In this study, we analyzed a comprehensive large retrospective breast cancer cohort with a special focus on histological subtype (other than ductal non-special type or lobular carcinoma) and correlated pure or mixed histological forms with pathological tumor stage and overall disease-free survival. A total of 827 breast cancer cases with pure or mixed special histological types were retrospectively analyzed. Survival information was available in 645 of 827 cases. A total of 293 cases had pure forms, and 534 cases had mixed histological subtypes. The most common pure special types were mucinous (23.9%), micropapillary (21.2%), high-grade metaplastic (13%), male breast cancer (8.2%), cribriform (6.8%), metastases (6.1%), apocrine and papillary (each 5.46%), NST with medullary and clear cell pattern (up to 3.4%) and high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (2.7%). Mixed forms were most frequently encountered in NST carcinomas with micropapillary components (41.8%), followed by mucinous (9.93%) and cribriform (6.74%) mixed patterns. In univariate analysis, no pure form had prognostic relevance compared with any mixed form with the basic pure element. Pooling pure histological subtypes with tumor stage and age in a linear random-effects model, the cribriform subtype had the most favorable prognosis, while male breast cancer showed the poorest outcome (p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001). All other frequent pure forms had intermediate prognostic power (p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001). Our results show that the analyzed special&#160;histological breast cancer subtypes (other than ductal and lobular carcinomas) do not carry prognostic information alone, either in pure form or in any combination with other subtypes. Prognostic groups including special subtypes, however, can strongly stratify breast cancer if tumor stage, age and biomarkers are included in the prognostic measurements. ",

        "AbstractText": "In physiological concentrations, heme is nontoxic to the cell and is essential for cell survival and proliferation. Increasing intracellular heme concentrations beyond normal levels, however, will lead to carcinogenesis and facilitate the survival of tumor cells. Simultaneously, heme in an abnormally high quantity is also a potent inducer of tumor cell death, contributing to its ability to generate oxidative stress on the cells by boosting oxidative phosphorylation and suppressing tumors through ferroptosis. During tumorigenesis and progression, therefore, heme works as a double-edged sword. Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in heme catabolism, which converts heme into physiologically active catabolites of carbon monoxide (CO), biliverdin, and ferrous iron (Fe2+). HO-1 maintains redox equilibrium in healthy cells and functions as a carcinogenesis inhibitor. It is widely recognized that HO-1 is involved in the adaptive response to cellular stress and the anti-inflammation effect. Notably, its expression level in cancer cells corresponds with tumor growth, aggressiveness, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Besides, heme-binding transcription factor BTB and CNC homology 1 (Bach1) play a critical regulatory role in heme homeostasis, oxidative stress and senescence, cell cycle, angiogenesis, immune cell differentiation, and autoimmune disorders. Moreover, it was found that Bach1 influences cancer cells' metabolism and metastatic capacity. Bach1 controls heme level by adjusting HO-1 expression, establishing a negative feedback loop. Herein, the authors review recent studies on heme, HO-1, and Bach1 in cancer. Specifically, they cover the following areas: (1) the carcinogenic and anticarcinogenic aspects of heme; (2) the carcinogenic and anticarcinogenic aspects of HO-1; (3) the carcinogenic and anticarcinogenic aspects of Bach1; (4) the interactions of the heme/HO-1/Bach1 axis involved in tumor progression.

        "AbstractText": "Activity estimates should be accurately evaluated in phase 2 clinical trials to ensure appropriate decisions about proceeding to phase 3 trials. RECIST v1.1. progression-free survival (PFS) is a common endpoint in oncology; however, it can be influenced by assessment criteria and trial design. We assessed the value of central adjudication of investigator-assessed PFS times of participants in a double-blind, randomised phase 2 trial evaluating regorafenib versus placebo in advanced gastro-oesophageal cancer (AGITG INTEGRATE) to inform plans for central review in future trials. We calculated the proportion of participants with a disagreement between the site investigator assessment and blinded independent central review and in whom central review resulted in a change, then evaluated the effect of central review on study conclusions by comparing hazard ratios (HRs) for PFS based on site review versus central review. Post-progression unblinding was assessed with similar methods. Simulation studies explored the effect of differential and non-differential measurement error on treatment effect estimation and study power. Disagreements between site assessments versus central review occurred in 8/147 (5.4%) participants, 5 resulting in amended date of progression (3.4%). PFS HRs (sites vs central review progression dates) were similar (0.39 vs 0.40). RECIST progression occurred in 82/86 (95%) of cases where post-progression unblinding was requested by the site investigator. Blinded independent central review was feasible and supported the reliability of site assessments, trial results, and conclusions. Modelling showed that when treatment effects were large and outcome assessments blinded, central review was unlikely to affect conclusions. ",

        "AbstractText": "Adrenal tumors, including benign cortical adenoma (BCA) and pheochromocytoma (PCC) or paraganglioma (PGL), have been more frequently detected during imaging examinations in recent years. However, the associated clinical or laboratory characteristics, especially on the Chinese population, still need to be investigated. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 491 patients pathologically diagnosed with adrenal tumors, from Jan 19, 2018 to Dec 17, 2019, at a tertiary referral hospital in Wuhan of China. Our findings including 247 (50.3%) BCA cases, and 92 (18.7) PCC/PGL cases and other cases. Both the clinical and laboratory parameters were reviewed and analyzed. Compared with other adrenal tumors, PCC/PGL showed larger tumor diameters and more frequently located on the right side, and were with higher levels of urinary catecholoamines and plasma metanephrines, especially for the 24&#160;h urinary vanilmandelic acid (VMA) and plasma normetanephrine (NMN). The optimal diagnostic thresholds were 29.40 ug/24&#160;h for VMA (sensitivity, 85%; specificity, 91%) and 0.63&#160;nmol/L for NMN (sensitivity, 91%; specificity, 92%). The 24&#160;h urinary VMA and plasma NMN also shared abilities to differentiate between different tumor laterality and different tumor size in PCC/PGL cases. In addition, compared with the other benign tumors, BCA were smaller in diameters (20 vs 35&#160;mm, p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001), and seemed to be lower in levels of plasma epinephrine, dopamine and serum ACTH. 24&#160;h Urinary catecholoamines and plasma metanephrines, especially for the 24&#160;h urinary VMA and plasma MNM, showed higher diagnostic efficacies for PCC/PGL, and were tightly associated with the tumor laterality and tumor size.

Although fibroblasts and macrophages are known as key cellular players for fibrosis development, a comprehensive functional model that considers their interaction in the metabolic/immunologic context of fibrotic tissue has not been set up. Here we show, by transcriptome-based mathematical modeling in an in vitro system that represents macrophage-fibroblast interplay and reflects the functional effects of inflammation, hypoxia and the adaptive immune context, that irreversible fibrosis development is associated with specific combinations of metabolic and inflammatory cues. The in vitro signatures are in good alignment with transcriptomic profiles generated on laser captured glomeruli and cortical tubule-interstitial area, isolated from human transplanted kidneys with advanced stages of glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy, two clinically relevant conditions associated with organ failure in renal allografts. The model we describe here is validated on tissue based quantitative immune-phenotyping of biopsies from transplanted kidneys, demonstrating its feasibility. We conclude that the combination of in vitro and in silico modeling represents a powerful systems medicine approach to dissect fibrosis pathogenesis, applicable to specific pathological conditions, and develop coordinated targeted approaches.

The growing amount of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data also provides insights into improving therapeutic effectiveness by helping to study the heterogeneity of drug responses for cancer cell subpopulations. Developing computational approaches to predict and interpret cancer drug response in single-cell data collected from clinical samples can be very useful. We propose scDEAL, a deep transfer learning framework for cancer drug response prediction at the single-cell level by integrating large-scale bulk cell-line data. The highlight in scDEAL involves harmonizing drug-related bulk RNA-seq data with scRNA-seq data and transferring the model trained on bulk RNA-seq data to predict drug responses in scRNA-seq. Another feature of scDEAL is the integrated gradient feature interpretation to infer the signature genes of drug resistance mechanisms. We benchmark scDEAL on six scRNA-seq datasets and demonstrate its model interpretability via three case studies focusing on drug response label prediction, gene signature identification, and pseudotime analysis. We believe that scDEAL could help study cell reprogramming, drug selection, and repurposing for improving therapeutic efficacy. ",

        "AbstractText": "Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the sixth leading cause of cancer-associated death worldwide with a dismal overall 5-year survival rate of less than 20%. The standard first-line therapy for advanced ESCC is concomitant chemo-radiation therapy (CCRT); however, patients usually develop resistance, resulting in unfavorable outcomes. Therefore, it is urgent to identify the mechanisms underlying CCRT resistance and develop effective treatment strategies. Patients' endoscopic biopsy tumor tissues obtained before CCRT treatment were used to perform RNA-seq and GSEA analysis. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and promoter reporter analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between SOX17 and NRF2. Xenograft mouse models were used to study the role of SOX17/NRF2 axis in tumor growth and the efficacy of carboxymethyl cellulose-coated zero-valent-iron (ZVI@CMC). In this study, a notable gene expression signature associated with NRF2 activation was observed in the poor CCRT responders. Further, IHC staining of endoscopic biopsy of 164 ESCC patients revealed an inverse correlation between NRF2 and SOX17, a tumor-suppressive transcription factor with low expression in ESCC due to promoter hypermethylation. Using ChIP and promoter reporter analyses, we demonstrated that SOX17 was a novel upstream transcriptional suppressor of NRF2. In particular, SOX17low/NRF2high nuclear level significantly correlated with poor CCRT response and poor survival, indicating that the dysregulation of SOX17/NRF2 axis played a pivotal role in CCRT resistance and tumor progression. Notably, the in-house developed nanoparticle ZVI@CMC functioned as an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases to restore expression of SOX17 that downregulated NRF2, thereby overcoming the resistance in ESCC. Additionally, the combination of ZVI@CMC with radiation treatment significantly augmented anticancer efficacy to inhibit tumor growth in CCRT resistant cancer. This study identifies a novel SOX17low/NRF2high signature in ESCC patients with poor prognosis, recognizes SOX17 as a transcriptional repressor of NRF2, and provides a promising strategy targeting SOX17/NRF2 axis to overcome resistance.

Here, we present the first attempt to combine oncolytic herpes simplex virus 2 (OH2) with an anti-SIRP&#945; antibody as an antitumour treatment. Our results provide unique insight into the combination of innate immunity with OV. We verified the polarization and activation of OH2 in RAW264.7 cells in vitro. Subsequently, we evaluated the antitumour ability of OH2 and anti-SIRP&#945; combined therapy in a tumour-bearing mouse model. RNA-seq and Single-cell RNA-seq were used to characterize the changes in the tumour microenvironment. The OH2 lysates effectively stimulated RAW264.7 cells to polarize towards the M1 but not the M2 phenotype and activated the function of the M1 phenotype in vitro. In the macrophage clearance experiment, OH2 therapy induced polarization of M1 macrophages and participated in the antitumour immune response in a tumour-bearing mouse model. Treatment with a combination of OH2 and anti-SIRP&#945; effectively inhibited tumour growth and significantly prolonged the survival time of the mice, and this result was more obvious in the mouse model with a larger tumour volume at the beginning of the treatment. These results suggest that combination therapy can more profoundly reshape the TME and activate stronger innate and adaptive immune responses.

We hereby retrospectively compared the efficacy and safety between these two treatment regimens and explored the predictive power of thymidylate synthase (TYMS), an enzyme involved in the DNA synthesis process and metabolism of fluorouracil. This study included patients with a primary diagnosis of unresectable HCC. These patients received HAIC for 1 day or 2 days. The overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), tumor response, and adverse events were compared. The propensity score matching (PSM) was used to reduce bias. Peripheral blood samples before the treatments were collected and used to measure the concentration of TYMS through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Exposures to particulate matter with a diameter &#8804; 10 &#956;m (PM10), PM2.5, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and NO2 for each transition stage were estimated at each participant's residential addresses using data from the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The outcomes were incident T2D, diabetes complications (diabetic kidney disease, diabetic eye disease, diabetic neuropathy disease, peripheral vascular disease, cardiovascular events, and metabolic events), all-cause mortality, and cause-specific mortality. Multi-state model was used to analyze the impact of air pollution on different progressions of T2D. Cumulative transition probabilities of different stages of T2D under different air pollution levels were estimated. During the 12-year follow-up, 13,393 incident T2D patients were identified, of whom, 3791 developed diabetes complications and 1335 died. We observed that air pollution was associated with different progression stages of T2D with different magnitudes. In a multivariate model, the hazard ratios [95% confidence interval (CI)] per interquartile range elevation in PM2.5 were 1.63 (1.59, 1.67) and 1.08 (1.03, 1.13) for transitions from healthy to T2D and from T2D to complications, and 1.50 (1.47, 1.53), 1.49 (1.36, 1.64), and 1.54 (1.35, 1.76) for mortality risk from baseline, T2D, and diabetes complications, respectively. Generally, we observed stronger estimates of four air pollutants on transition from baseline to incident T2D than those on other transitions. Moreover, we found significant associations between four air pollutants and mortality risk due to cancer and cardiovascular diseases from T2D or diabetes complications. The cumulative transition probability was generally higher among those with higher levels of air pollution exposure. This study indicates that ambient air pollution exposure may contribute to increased risk of incidence and progressions of T2D, but to diverse extents for different progressions. ",

An increase in ELMO1 expression was specifically found in TAMs, but not in other multiple non-malignant stromal cells. Gain- and loss-of-function assays indicated ELMO1 reprogrammed macrophages to a TAM-like phenotype via Rac1 activation. In turn, ELMO1-reprogrammed macrophages were shown to not only facilitate the malignant behaviors of CRC cells but exhibited potent phagocytosis of tumor cells.

The m6 A-modified CBX1 mRNA transcript is recognized and destabilized by the m6 A reader YTHDF3. Furthermore, it is revealed that CBX1 promotes NPC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation through transcriptional repression of MAP7 via H3K9me3-mediated heterochromatin formation. In addition to its oncogenic effect, CBX1 can facilitate immune evasion through IFN-&#947;-STAT1 signaling-mediated PD-L1 upregulation. Clinically, CBX1 serves as an independent predictor for unfavorable prognosis in NPC patients.

This work presents a ferrocene-containing Ir(III) photosensitizer (IrFc1) that can bind with transferrin and be transported into triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells via a transferrin receptor-mediated pathway. When the ferrocene in IrFc1 is oxidized by reactive oxygen species, its capability to photosensitize both type I (electron transfer) and type II (energy transfer) pathways is activated through a self-amplifying process. Upon irradiation, IrFc1 induces the generation of lipid oxidation to cause ferroptosis in TNBC cells, which promotes immunogenic cell death (ICD) under both normoxia and hypoxia. In vivo, IrFc1 treatment elicits a CD8+ T-cell response, which activates ICD in TNBC resulting in enhanced anticancer immunity.

        "ArticleTitle": "Genome-Wide CRISPR/Cas9 Library Screening Revealed Dietary Restriction of Glutamine in Combination with Inhibition of Pyruvate Metabolism as Effective Liver Cancer Treatment. ",
        "AbstractText": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most lethal cancer worldwide. Glutamine is an essential, extracellular nutrient which supports HCC growth. Dietary glutamine deficiency may be a potential therapeutic approach for HCC. HCC cells overcome metabolic challenges by rewiring their metabolic pathways for rapid adaptations. The efficiency of dietary glutamine deficiency as HCC treatment is examined and the adaptation machinery under glutamine depletion in HCC cells is unraveled. Using genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout library screening, this study identifies that pyruvate dehydrogenase &#945; (PDHA), pyruvate dehydrogenase &#946; (PDHB), and pyruvate carboxylase (PC) in pyruvate metabolism are crucial to the adaptation of glutamine depletion in HCC cells. Knockout of either PDHA, PDHB or PC induced metabolic reprogramming of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, disrupts mitochondrial function, leading to the suppression of HCC cell proliferation under glutamine depletion. Surprisingly, dietary glutamine restriction improves therapeutic responses of HCC to PDH or PC inhibitor in mouse HCC models. Stable isotope carbon tracing confirms that PDH or PC inhibitors further disrupt the metabolic rewiring of the TCA cycle induced by dietary glutamine depletion in HCC. In summary, the results demonstrate that pyruvate metabolism acts as novel targetable metabolic vulnerabilities for HCC treatment in combination with a glutamine-deficient diet. ",

        "AbstractText": "This study was performed to characterize the metabolic alteration of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and discover blood-based metabolic biomarkers relevant to lung cancer detection. An untargeted metabolomics-based approach was applied in a case-control study with 193 NSCLC patients and 243 healthy controls. Serum metabolomics were determined by using an ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method. We screened differential metabolites based on univariate and multivariate analysis, followed by identification of the metabolites and related pathways. For NSCLC detection, machine learning was employed to develop and validate the model based on the altered serum metabolite features. The serum metabolic pattern of NSCLC was definitely different from healthy condition. A total of 278 altered features were found in serum of NSCLC patients comparing with healthy people. About one fifth of the abundant differential features were identified successfully. The altered metabolites were enriched in metabolic pathways such as phenylalanine metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, and biosynthesis of bile acids. We demonstrated a panel of 10 metabolic biomarkers which representing excellent discriminating capability for NSCLC discrimination, with a combined area under the curve (AUC) in the validation set of 0.95 (95%CI: 0.91-0.98). Moreover, this model showed a desirable performance for the detection of NSCLC in an early stage (AUC&#160;=&#160;0.95, 95%CI: 0.92-0.97). Our study offers a perspective on NSCLC metabolic alteration. The finding of the biomarkers might shed light on the clinical detection of lung cancer, especially for those cancers in an early stage in Chinese population. ",

        "AbstractText": "The nuclear RNA surveillance mechanism is essential for cancer cell survival and is ensured by the RNA nuclear exosome including some co-factors, such as the RNA helicase MTR4. Recent studies suggest an involvement of DNA repair proteins such as APE1, a major endodeoxyribonuclease of Base Excision Repair (BER), in RNA metabolism and RNA decay of oxidized and abasic RNA. Cisplatin (CDDP) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) are commonly used for the treatment of solid tumors. Whether APE1 is involved in the elimination of CDDP- or 5-FU-damaged RNA is unknown, as is its possible interaction with the nuclear exosome complex. Here, by using different human cancer cell models, we demonstrated that: i) APE1 is involved in the elimination of damaged-RNA, upon CDDP- and 5-FU-treatments, in a MTR4-independent manner; ii) the interaction between APE1 and MTR4 is stimulated by CDDP- and 5-FU-treatments through lysine residues in the APE1 N-terminal region and is, in part, mediated by nucleic acids; and iii) APE1- and MTR4-depletion lead to the generation of R-loop formation causing the activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway through the ATM-p53-p21 axis. Our data demonstrate a role of MTR4 in DDR underpinning the function of APE1 in controlling the RNA quality upon genotoxic treatments with possible implications in chemoresistance. ",

        "AbstractText": "In the present study, a drug-like molecular hybrid structure between chalcone and sulfonamide moieties was synthesized and characterized. The structural peculiarities of the synthesized hybrid were further verified by means of single crystal X-ray crystallography. Furthermore, its biological activity as an anticancer agent was evaluated. The synthesized model of chalcone-sulfonamide hybrid 3 was found to have potent anticancer properties against the studied cancer cell lines. Hence, the in&#160;vitro binding interaction of hybrid 3 with Calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) was studied at a simulated physiological pH to confirm its anticancer activity for the first time. This was investigated by applying different spectroscopic techniques, ionic strength measurements, viscosity measurements, thermodynamics, molecular dynamic simulation and molecular docking studies. The obtained results showed a clear binding interaction between hybrid 3 and CT-DNA with a moderate affinity via a minor groove binding mechanism. The binding constant (Kb) at 298&#8201;K calculated from the Benesi-Hildebrand equation was found to be 3.49&#8201;&#215;&#8201;104 M-1. The entropy and enthalpy changes (&#916;S0 and &#916;H0) were 204.65&#8201;J mol-1 K-1 and 35.08&#8201;KJ mol-1, respectively, indicating that hydrophobic interactions constituted the major binding forces. The results obtained from molecular docking and dynamic simulation studies confirmed the minor groove binding interaction and the stability of the formed complex. This study can contribute to further understanding of the molecular mechanism of hybrid 3 as a potential antitumor agent and can also guide future clinical and pharmacological studies for rational drug design with enhanced or more selective activity and greater efficacy.

        "AbstractText": "Although cigarette smoking is an established risk factor for bladder cancer, assessment of smoking impact on bladder cancer in Asian populations has been hindered by few cohort studies conducted in Asian populations. We therefore investigated the risk of bladder cancer associated with smoking status, cumulative smoking intensity and smoking cessation in Japan. We analyzed data for 157,295 men and 183,202 women in ten population-based cohort studies in Japan. The risk associated with smoking behaviors was estimated using Cox regression models within each study, and pooled hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the incidence of bladder cancer were calculated. During 4,729,073 person-years of follow up, 936 men and 325 women developed bladder cancer. In men, former smokers (HR 1.47; 95% CI, 1.18-1.82) and current smokers (HR 1.96; 95% CI, 1.62-2.38) had higher risk than never smokers. In women, current smokers had higher risk than never smokers (HR 2.35; 95% CI, 1.67-3.32). HRs in men linearly increased with increasing pack-years. Risk decreased with increasing years of smoking cessation in men with a significant dose-response trend. Former smokers with a duration of more than 10 years after smoking cessation had no significantly increased risk compared with never smokers (HR 1.26; 95% CI, 0.97-1.63). Data from a pooled analysis of ten population-based cohort studies in Japan clearly show an association between cigarette smoking and bladder cancer risk. The risk of smokers may approximate that of never smokers following cessation for many years. ",

        "AbstractText": "Acalabrutinib is a covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor approved for relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. A major metabolite of acalabrutinib (M27, ACP-5862) was observed in human plasma circulation. Subsequently, the metabolite was purified from an in vitro biosynthetic reaction and shown by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to be a pyrrolidine ring-opened ketone/amide. Synthesis confirmed its structure, and covalent inhibition of wild-type BTK was observed in a biochemical kinase assay. A 2-fold lower potency (kinact/KI) than acalabrutinib was observed, but with similar high kinase selectivity. Like acalabrutinib, ACP-5862 was the most selective toward BTK relative to ibrutinib and zanubrutinib. Because of the potency, ACP-5862 covalent binding properties, and potential contribution to clinical efficacy of acalabrutinib, factors influencing acalabrutinib clearance and ACP-5862 formation and clearance were assessed. rCYP reaction phenotyping indicated CYP3A4 was responsible for ACP&#8209;5862 formation and metabolism. ACP&#8209;5862 formation Km and Vmax were 2.78 &#956;M and 4.13 pmol/pmol CYP3A/min, respectively. ACP&#8209;5862 intrinsic clearance was 23.6 &#956;L/min/mg. Acalabrutinib weakly inhibited CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, and ACP&#8209;5862 weakly inhibited CYP2C9 and CYP2C19; other CYPs, UGTs, and aldehyde oxidase were not inhibited. Neither parent nor ACP&#8209;5862 strongly induced CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 mRNA. Acalabrutinib and ACP&#8209;5862 were substrates of multi-drug resistance protein 1 and breast cancer resistance protein, but not OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. Our work indicates that ACP-5862 may contribute to clinical efficacy in acalabrutinib-treated patients and illustrates how proactive metabolite characterization allows timely assessment of drug-drug interactions and potential contributions of metabolites to pharmacological activity. Significance Statement This work characterized the major metabolite of acalabrutinib, ACP-5862 Its contribution to the pharmacological activity of acalabrutinib was assessed based on covalent BTK binding kinetics, kinase selectivity, and potency in cellular assays. The metabolic clearance and in vitro drug-drug interaction potential were also evaluated for both acalabrutinib and ACP-5862. The current data suggest that ACP-5862 may contribute to the clinical efficacy observed in acalabrutinib-treated patients and demonstrates the value of proactive metabolite identification and pharmacological characterization.

We investigated neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) plus local excision (LE) as an alternative treatment strategy for patients with cT2N0 rectal cancer. Fifty-six patients with cT2N0M0 rectal cancer who exhibited the following characteristics (an anal verge of &#8804;8 cm, tumor size of <30 mm, well or moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma on biopsy) underwent LE following nCRT. Chemoradiotherapy was administered at 40 or 45 Gy in 20-25 fractions with concurrent oral UFT (tegafur/uracil; 400 mg/m2) or S-1 (tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil; 80 mg/m2). Fifty-five patients (98%) completed nCRT as planned. Histologically, the excision margin was negative in all patients, and four patients with ypT3 disease underwent total mesorectal excision. Recurrence was observed in 15 patients (27%); local recurrence in 7 (13%) and distant in 10 (18%). The salvage surgery was possible for the local recurrence group. The 5-year disease-free and overall survival rates were 68.4% and 84.9%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that only the TRG was an independent risk factor for recurrence (p = 0.025). Although 7 (26%) out of 27 patients with a tumor regression grade (TRG) of 3 or 4 developed local recurrence and 6 (22%) had distant metastasis, 25 patients with a TRG of 1 or 2 did not exhibit local recurrence, and only 1 (4%) experienced distant metastasis. nCRT plus LE may be an alternative treatment for patients with cT2N0 rectal cancer who achieved a TRG of 1 or 2.

Patients who underwent cervical conization at our hospital between July 2009 and June 2018 were enrolled. HPV genotyping was performed preoperatively for all patients with HPV-positive. The association among preoperative and postoperative HR-HPV genotyping results, the cumulative risk of cytological abnormalities, and additional surgery were evaluated. The endpoint approach was used to investigate the cumulative incidence of additional surgery owing to cytological abnormalities, such as low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion positivity and recurrence 2 years after cervical conization. Positive and negative histological margins were observed in 21 and 287 of 308 cases, respectively. The cumulative incidence of abnormal cytology and additional surgery was significantly higher in margin-positive cases than that in margin-negative cases. Examination established according to the margin status demonstrated that the postoperative HR-HPV-positive group had a significantly worse prognosis than the HR-HPV-negative group. Additionally, 32 cases, wherein the same genotype detected before and after surgery, demonstrated significantly unfavorable outcomes. Fifteen patients with persistent HPV 16/18 had the worst prognosis than the other types. Preoperative and postoperative HR-HPV genotype tests were used to predict the cumulative incidence of abnormal cytology and additional surgery.

        "AbstractText": "1q gain (+1q) is the most common high-risk cytogenetic abnormality (HRCA) in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). However, its prognostic value remains unclear in the era of novel agents. Here, we retrospectively analyzed the impact of +1q on the outcomes of 934 patients newly diagnosed with MM. +1q was identified in 53.1% of patients and verified as an independent variate for inferior overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio, 1.400; 95% CI, 1.097-1.787; P =&#8201;0.007). Concurrence of other HRCAs [particularly t(14;16) and del(17p)] further exacerbated the outcomes of patients with +1q, suggesting prognostic heterogeneity. Thus, a risk-scoring algorithm based on four risk variates [t(14;16), hypercalcemia, ISS III, and high LDH] was developed to estimate the outcomes of patients with +1q. Of the patients, 376 evaluable patients with +1q were re-stratified into low (31.6%), intermediate (61.7%), and high risk (6.7%) groups, with significantly different progression-free survival and OS (P <&#8201;0.0001), in association with early relapse of the disease. The prognostic value of this model was validated in the CoMMpass cohort. While attaining undetectable MRD largely circumvented the adverse impact of +1q, the model scarcely ameliorated the outcome of the patients with high risk, who likely represent a subset of patients with extremely poor survival. Hence, patients with +1q are a heterogeneous group of high-risk patients, therefore underlining the necessity for their re-stratification. The proposed simple risk-scoring model can estimate the outcomes of patients with +1q, which may help guide risk-adapted treatment for such patients. This article is protected by copyright.

        "AbstractText": "Signal peptide (SP) plays an important role in membrane targeting for insertion of secretory and membrane proteins during translocation processes in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Beside the targeting functions, SP has also been found to affect the stability and folding of several proteins. Serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins are apolipoproteins responding to acute-phase inflammation. The fibrillization of SAA results in a protein misfolding disease named Amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis. The main disease-associated isoform of human SAA, SAA1.1, is expressed as a precursor protein with an N-terminal signal peptide composed of 18 residues. The cleavage of the SP generates mature SAA1.1. To investigate whether the SP affects properties of SAA1.1, we systematically examined the structure, protein stability, and fibrillization propensity of pre-SAA1.1, which possesses the SP, and Ser-SAA1.1 without the SP but containing with an additional N-terminal serine residue. We found that the presence of the SP did not significantly affect the predominant helical structure but changed the tertiary conformation as evidenced by intrinsic fluorescence and exposed hydrophobic surfaces. Pre-SAA1.1 and Ser-SAA1.1 formed distinct oligomeric assemblies in which pre-SAA1.1 populated as tetramer and octamer, whereas Ser-SAA1.1 existed as a predominant hexamer. Pre-SAA1.1 was found significantly more stable than Ser-SAA1.1 upon thermal and chemical unfolding. Ser-SAA1.1, but not pre-SAA1.1, is capable of forming amyloid fibrils in protein misfolding study, indicating a protective role of the SP. Altogether, our results demonstrated a novel role of the SP in SAA folding and misfolding and provided a novel direction for therapeutic development of AA amyloidosis.

Although the role of some miRNAs that are often dysregulated in breast cancer has been deciphered, the regulatory function of others still remains unknown. The current study was aimed at determining the biological role and underlying mechanism of miR-548k in breast cancer. In this study, the significant overexpression of miR-548k in breast cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues was confirmed. Also, bioinformatics analysis indicated that PTEN, as a negative regulator of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, was a potential target of miR-548k, and its expression was downregulated in breast cancer tissues rather than normal tissues. Furthermore, the ectopic increase of miR-548k decreased the expression of PTEN in breast cancer, suggesting that PTEN is one of the potential downstream targets of miR-548k. Besides, functional analysis was conducted to assess the capability of miR-548k to alter apoptosis along with the changed expression levels of miR-548k in breast cancer cells. Based on this investigation, forced increase of miR-548k disrupted programmed cell death in MCF-7 cells. Apart from this, in silico study of miR-548 family supported its association with the main components of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, opening a prospective research area in cancer therapy. In brief, suppression of PTEN partly mediated by miR-548k diminished apoptosis and promoted cell proliferation through PI3K/Akt pathway in breast cancer, suggesting a novel therapeutic axis, miR-548k/PTEN/ PI3K/Akt, for treatment of breast cancer in the future.

Abnormal iron levels have been extensively associated with tau pathology in neurodegenerative brains, however its role in PSP pathogenesis remains yet unknown. We perform the first cell type-specific evaluation of PSP iron homeostasis and the closely related oxygen homeostasis, in relation to tau pathology in human post-mortem PSP brains. In brain regions vulnerable to PSP pathology (GP, SN, and putamen), we visualized iron deposition in tau-affected and unaffected neurons, astroglia, oligodendrocytes, and microglia, using a combination of iron staining with immunolabelling. To further explore molecular pathways underlying our observations, we examined the expression of key iron and oxygen homeostasis mRNA transcripts and proteins. We found astrocytes as the major cell type accumulating iron in the early affected regions of PSP, highly associated with cellular tau pathology. The same regions are affected by dysregulated expression of alpha and beta hemoglobin and neuroglobin showing contrasting patterns. We discovered changes in iron and oxygen homeostasis-related gene expression associated with aging of the brain, and identified dysregulated expression of rare Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation (NBIA) genes associated with tau pathology to distinguish PSP from the healthy ageing brain. We present novel aspects of PSP pathophysiology highlighting an overlap with NBIA pathways. Our findings reveal potential novel targets for therapy development and have implications beyond PSP for other iron-associated neurodegenerative diseases. This article is protected by copyright.

        "AbstractText": "The epigallocatechin-rich polyphenolic fraction of Assam variety white tea, traditionally used for the management of diverse inflammatory ailments and health drink, was investigated through eco-friendly green aqueous extraction, TLC, and HPLC characterization, phytochemical screening, in vitro DPPH assay, anti-proteinase, MTT assay on synovial fibroblast and colon cancer cells, apoptotic FACS analysis, cytokine ELISA, p-STAT3 western blotting, and in silico docking analysis. HPLC-TLC standardized white tea fraction (WT-F) rendered higher extractive-yield (21%, w/w), than green tea fraction(GT-F) (12%, w/w). WT-F containing flavonoids and non-hydrolysable polyphenols showed better antioxidant activity, rather than equivalent GT-F. WT-F demonstrated remarkable anti-rheumatoid-arthritis activity via killing of synovial fibroblast cells (66.1%), downregulation of TNF-&#945; (93.33%), IL-6 (87.97%), and p-STAT3 inhibition (77.75%). Furthermore, WT-F demonstrated better anti-proliferative activity against colon cancer cells (HCT-116). Collectively, our study revealed that the white tea fraction has boundless potential as anti-rheumatoid arthritis and anti-proliferative agent coupled with apoptotic, antioxidant anti-proteinase, and anti-inflammatory properties. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Our eco-friendly extracted bioactive aqueous fraction of white tea, characterized by TLC-HPLC study and phytochemical screening have demonstrated remarkable anti-rheumatoid arthritis property and anti-proliferative action on colon cancer cells including potential anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-proteinase efficacy. The test WT-F sample has shown impressive safety on normal mammalian cells. WT-F has demonstrated better efficacy against rheumatoid arthritis and cancer model compared to equivalent green tea fraction. Traditionally, it is extensively used for boosting immunity, and energy, with cosmetic, and agricultural applications by the native inhabitants. So, the aqueous fraction of WT is suggested to be used as a prophylactic nutraceutical supplement and or therapeutic agent in commercial polyherbal formulation to attenuate and management of auto-inflammatory rheumatoid arthritis and carcinogenesis of colon. It is additionally suggested to establish in vivo rheumatoid arthritis animal and clinical study to validate their pharmacokinetic stability and dose optimization coupled with anti-inflammatory, cytotoxicity, and anti-oxidant property.

        "AbstractText": "To investigate whether extensive renal artery isolation during robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) affects blood pressure (BP) of patients with poorly controlled hypertension. We included 60 patients diagnosed with poorly controlled hypertension who underwent RAPN by an experienced surgeon. The renal artery of the treated kidney was sufficiently isolated. Systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP) and antihypertensive medication information were obtained at baseline and 3- and 6-month follow-up after surgery. Primary endpoints were changes in BP, and medications. Predictors of SBP reduction at 3&#160;months were assessed by multivariable logistic regression. All 60 RAPN procedures were successful, with no major intra- or postoperative complications. Mean SBP and DBP decreased significantly at 3&#160;months after surgery (SBP, -7.8&#8201;&#177;&#8201;6.3&#160;mmHg, P&#8201;<&#8201;0.001; DBP, -4.2&#8201;&#177;&#8201;6.4&#160;mmHg, P&#8201;=&#8201;0.01). SBP and DBP did not differ between 3- and 6-month follow-up. The mean number of BP medications prescribed was lower at 3&#160;months than baseline (1.7&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1.0 vs 2.1&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1.0, P&#8201;=&#8201;0.016). The only significant predictor of SBP reduction at 3&#160;months was baseline SBP. Renal denervation with extensive renal artery isolation during RAPN may improve BP control among patients with poorly controlled hypertension in short term. ",

PEComas occur most frequently in the kidney, uterus, the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and retroperitoneum; those originating in the biliary tree are extremely rare. We report a case of benign PEComa of the cystic duct with positive TFE3 staining on immunohistochemistry.A 66-year-old woman was referred for a 20&#160;mm mass adjacent to the common bile duct discovered incidentally on abdominal ultrasound. Laboratory data including tumor markers were unremarkable. The tumor appeared to arise from the cystic duct, showed early enhancement, and compressed the common bile duct on imaging studies. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration revealed round- and spindle-shaped atypical cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and brown deposits suggestive of melanin granules. Histological examination of the resected specimen revealed a tumor consisting of epithelioid cells forming an alveolar structure, with melanin pigmentation. Immunohistochemistry was positive for HMB-45 and TFE3, consistent with benign pigmented PEComa of the cystic duct. Melanotic, myogenic, and TFE3 staining are helpful when diagnosing PEComas arising in unusual locations. ",

        "AbstractText": "A substantial need for effective and safe treatment options is still unmet for patients with heavily pre-treated human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Herein, we assessed the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib plus trastuzumab and chemotherapy in patients with heavily treated HER2-positive MBC. In this single-arm exploratory phase II trial, patients with HER2-positive MBC previously treated with trastuzumab plus lapatinib or pertuzumab, received pyrotinib plus trastuzumab and chemotherapy. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) in the total population (TP). Secondary end points included PFS in the subgroup with brain metastases (Sub-BrM), confirmed objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), disease control rate (DCR), exploration of predictive factors of PFS, and safety. Between November 1, 2018, and March 31, 2021, 40 patients were eligible for this study. The median PFS reached 7.5&#160;months (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.7 to 9.9&#160;months) and 9.4&#160;months (95% CI 6.6 to 12.1&#160;months) in the TP and Sub-BrM, respectively. ORR was 50.5% (20/40). CBR was 75.5% (30/40) and DCR reached 97.5% (39/40). Cox univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that liver or/and lung metastases was the significant adverse prognostic factor for PFS (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.018; p&#8201;=&#8201;0.026; respectively). The most frequent grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were diarrhea, neutropenia and leukopenia. No new safety signals were observed. Pyrotinib plus trastuzumab and chemotherapy offered a promising option with manageable safety profile for heavily pre-treated HER2-positive MBC, especially for those without liver or/and lung metastases.

The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic yield and prognostic significance of EBUS-TBNA in these patients. Retrospective analysis of patients with EM and abnormal MLN detected by Computed Tomography (CT) and/or Positron Emission Tomography (PET). A total of 161 patients with EM and abnormal MLN were included (93 males, 58%). The most common EM was melanoma (19%) and gastrointestinal cancer (17%). Assessed lymph nodes were mediastinal in 70% of cases and hilar in 30%. The most frequently sampled lymph nodes were subcarinal (45%) and lower right paratracheal (21%).

According to the etiology, we distinguish between myeloproliferative disorders, parasitic infections, solid tumors, T-cell lymphomas and idiopathic forms. In our case report, the 49-year-old man was hospitalized with weight loss, leg edema and tachycardia. In his laboratory tests increased biliary obstructive parameters as well as extreme leukocytosis and eosinophilia had been highlighted. We started our evaluation with a strong suspicion of hematologic malignancy. The CT scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis described hepatosplenomegaly, multiple intrahepatic lesions and an uncertain solitary cystic lesion in the tail of the pancreas with abnormal lymph nodes and pleural fluid. The described CT image and the other clinical parameters were primarily consistent with the manifestation of chronic myeloid leukemia. However, the diagnosis was not confirmed by peripheral blood smear, flow cytometry, bone marrow biopsy or genetic tests. After these results, we continued the assessment towards solid tumor associated leukemoid reaction, core biopsy was performed to verify the liver lesions. The biopsy confirmed the infiltration of a poorly differentiated epithelial tumor as a metastasis of pancreatobiliary carcinoma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report on hypereosinophilic syndrome associated with gastrointestinal solid tumors in the Hungarian medical literature.

Previously, this alteration was mentioned using different names. Undoubtedly, the term of NAFPD is still rarely used in the Hungarian scientific literature, even the proper translation should be considered difficult. Pancreatic lipid accumulation is a clinical manifestation of ectopic occurrence of adipose tissue. NAFPD can be diagnosed by different imaging modalities. Although proper quantification of pancreatic lipid accumulation is challenging, ultrasonography and computed tomography are used in clinical practice. The prevalence of NAFPD was about 30-35% in different adult populations but a relatively higher frequency might also be observed in children and adolescents with obesity. NAFPD may influence both endocrine and exocrine functions of the pancreas. Clinical studies documented a close correlation between NAFPD and type 2 diabetes/metabolic syndrome. Local consequences of pancreatic lipid accumulation are less recognized but clinical observations suggested that NAFPD might play a role in the development of acute and chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and pancreatic exocrine dysfunction. Therapeutically, weight loss in patients with obesity, due to life-style modification, pharmacological intervention or bariatric surgery, may reduce pancreatic lipid accumulation. Importantly, antihyperglycemic treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes should be performed by using antidiabetic drugs providing not only proper glycaemic control but even weight loss. NAFPD is a relatively new clinical entity which is rather common and probably underdiagnosed. Basic and new data about NAFPD are of importance for clinicians working in the field of different specialties and sub-specialties (internal medicine, gastroenterology, diabetology, lipidology, obesitology, surgery).

In this paper, we will explore the different significance of the regulatory role of HSP70 in endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) level in pepsin-treated laryngeal epithelial cells and LC cells. In cell experiments, laryngeal epithelial cells and LC cells were selected and induced by different concentrations of pepsin. Cell activity was detected by CCK8, cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry, and autophagy was detected by autophagy detection kit. The expression of ER)-related proteins was detected by immunofluorescence (IF) and Western blot. Cell transfection was used to inhibit HSP70 expression in both cells, and ERS, apoptosis, and autophagy were measured using related techniques. In animal experiments, a mouse model bearing LC was established. TUNEL assay detected apoptosis, autophagy kit detected autophagy, and ER-related protein expression was detected by Western blot. HSP70 was increased in pepsin-stimulated laryngeal epithelial cells and LC cells, thereby inhibiting ER and ER-induced apoptosis and autophagy. Inhibition of HSP70 reduced the expression of glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78) in pepsin-stimulated laryngeal epithelial cells and LC cells, and only inhibited downstream apoptosis-related pathways in laryngeal epithelial cells rather than in LC cells. Inhibition of HSP70 and ER could significantly promote apoptosis and inhibit tumor growth in the absence of pepsin stimulation in vivo.

We performed a systematic review and conducted a retrospective analysis of TB infection in patients with lung cancer and ICI exposure to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes using PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. The time interval from ICI administration to diagnosis of TB between patients with and without a history of TB was compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis. A multivariate Cox regression model was used to identify potential risk factors associated with the time interval of TB development. Twenty-four studies including 53 patients with lung cancer were included. The median age of the patients was 64&#160;years. Eight patients had a history of TB. The median time interval from ICI administration to TB diagnosis was 3&#160;months. In retrospective analysis, 5 (1.16%, 95%CI 0.38% to 2.68%) patients with lung cancer developed TB during ICI treatment. The median time interval was 10.4&#160;months. In a pooled analysis, the median time interval in the without-TB and with-TB groups was 7.00 and 2.35&#160;months, respectively (P&#160;=&#160;.034).

We investigated the anti-chemoresistance characteristics of diallyl trisulfide (DATS) in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells, in vitro and in vivo. Previous preclinical studies have revealed that DATS regulates distinct hallmark cancer-signaling pathways. The cell cycle pathway is the most investigated signaling pathway in DATS. Additionally, post-DATS treatment has been found to promote proapoptotic capacity through the regulation of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathway components. In the present study, we found that treating cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant ovarian cell lines with DATS inhibited their proliferation and reduced their IC50. It induced cell apoptosis and promoted oxidative phosphorylation through the regulation of the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC1&#945; pathway, OXPHOS, and enhanced chemotherapy sensitivity.

Scientists have projected that by 2040, the prevalence will reach up to 3.2 million new cases annually due to population aging, disadvantageous diet transformations, and elevated exposure to risk factors. In the past decades, the five-year survival rate in colorectal cancer has significantly increased to 65% due to the development of an early endoscopic diagnosis and new chemotherapeutic approaches. Fluoropyrimidines, such as 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine, are commonly used to treat CRC. One of the most fundamental mechanisms of 5-FU is based on the inhibition of thymidylate synthase. This action is responsible for the therapeutic, but also toxic, effects of the drug. In this short review, we discuss the possible effects of vitamin D activity on colorectal cancer cells in relation to fluoropyrimidines. PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched up to January 2022 for studies on vitamin D and 5-fluorouracil interaction mechanisms. Original studies, case reports, and review articles were included. Vitamin D or its analogs target multiple biochemical pathways and modulate numerous pathophysiological mechanisms in the course of colon cancer, including those related to the pharmacological sites of fluoropyrimidines.

As MC simulations can be very time consuming for this kind of application, deep learning models have been considered to accelerate dose estimation in cancer patients. This work systematically evaluates the dose prediction accuracy, speed and generalisation performance of three selected state-of-the-art deep learning models for dose prediction applied to proton minibeam therapy. The strengths and weaknesses of those models are thoroughly investigated, helping other researchers to decide on a viable algorithm for their own&#160;application. The following recently published models are compared: first, a 3D U-Net model trained as a regression network, second, a 3D U-Net trained as a generator of a generative adversarial network (GAN) and third, a dose transformer model which interprets the dose prediction as a sequence translation task. These models are trained to emulate the result of MC simulations. The dose depositions of a proton minibeam with a diameter of 800&#8201;&#956;m and an energy of 20-100 MeV inside a simple head phantom calculated by full Geant4 MC simulations are used as a case study for this comparison. The spatial resolution is 0.5 mm. Special attention is put on the evaluation of the generalisation performance of the investigated&#160;models. Dose predictions with all models are produced in the order of a second on a GPU, the 3D U-Net models being fastest with an average of 130 ms. An investigated 3D U-Net regression model is found to show the strongest performance with overall 61.0&#177;0.5\\% of all voxels exhibiting a deviation in energy deposition prediction of less than 3\\% compared to full MC simulations with no spatial deviation allowed. The 3D U-Net models are observed to show better generalisation performance for target geometry variations while the transformer-based model shows better generalisation with regard to the proton&#160;energy. This paper reveals that (1) all studied deep learning models are significantly faster than non-machine learning approaches predicting the dose in the order of seconds compared to hours for MC, (2) all models provide reasonable accuracy and (3) the regression-trained 3D U-Net provides the most accurate&#160;predictions.

Indocyanine green fluorescence angiography (ICG-FA) can visualize tissue perfusion. We aimed to give an overview of the first experiences of ICG-FA and AL rate in colonic interposition. This study included all consecutive patients who underwent a colonic interposition between January 2015 and December 2021 at a tertiary referral center. Surgery was performed for the following indications: inability to use the stomach because of previous surgery or extensive tumour involvement, cancer recurrence in the gastric conduit, or because of complications after initial esophagectomy. Since 2018 ICG-FA was performed before anastomotic reconstruction by administration of ICG injection (0.1 mg/kg/bolus), using the Spy-phi (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI). Twenty-eight patients (9 female, mean age 62.8), underwent colonic interposition of whom 15 (54%) underwent ICG-FA-guided surgery. Within the ICG-FA group, three (20%) AL occurred, whereas in the non-ICG-FA group, three AL and one graft necrosis (31%) occurred (P=0.67). There was a change of management due to the FA assessment in three patients in the FA group (20%) which led to the choice of a different bowel segment for the anastomosis. Mean operative times in the ICG-FA and non-ICG-FA groups were 372&#177;99 and 399&#177;113 minutes, respectively (P=0.85).

A cross-sectional survey study was performed through YouGov&#174; using quota sampling methodology between March 22nd and March 31st 2021. Responses were matched and statistically weighted to UK adult population demographics, including those without internet access, and analysed according to percentage of respondents. Statistical significance was defined by p-value < 0.050. Ten thousand six hundred eighty-four participants completed the survey. 5,494 (51.4%) respondents believed that medical cannabis is legal in the UK. 684 (6.4%) participants consumed CBD for wellness reasons, 286 (2.7%) were prescribed CBD for a medical reason and 222 (2.1%) consumed CBD for another reason. 10,076 (94.3%) respondents were unaware of April 2021 regulations meaning that all over the counter CBD wellness products in the UK must conform to European Novel Foods Regulations. The most frequently reported main barriers to accessing medical cannabis were its association with recreational cannabis (n = 2,686; 25.1%), being unsure if it was legal (n = 2,276; 21.3%) and being unsure what medical conditions its can be used for (n = 1,863; 17.4%). A large proportion of respondents are unaware of the legislation and regulations surrounding medical cannabis and over the counter CBD wellness products. Lack of knowledge may present a barrier to safe access to either product. ",

        "AbstractText": "Infectious complications are the main causes of morbidity after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). Early enteral nutrition (EN) is a reasonable form of nutritional support that aims to mitigate the occurrence and severity of infectious complications by maintaining gut immunity. However, it remains unclear whether EN is beneficial for patients who underwent PD and are under enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol. A multicenter (six hospitals), open-label, randomized controlled trial will be started in July 2022. A total of 320 patients undergoing open PD will be randomly assigned to an EN group or a peripheral parental nutrition (PPN) group in a 1:1 ratio. The stratification factors will be the hospital, age (&#8805;&#8201;70 or not), and preoperative diagnosis (pancreatic cancer or not). In the EN group, enteral nutrition will start on postoperative day (POD) 1 at 200-300&#160;ml/day via the percutaneous tube placed operatively. The volume of the diet will be increased to 400-600&#160;ml/day on POD 2 and depend on the surgeon's decision from POD 3. In the PPN group, PPN will be delivered after surgery. In both groups, oral feeding will start on POD 3. Each treatment will be finished when patients' oral food intake reaches 60% of the nutritional requirement (25-30&#160;kcal/day). The primary endpoint will be the occurrence of postoperative infectious complications within 90&#160;days of surgery. The secondary endpoints will be all complications, including major ones such as Clavien-Dindo grade 3 or more and clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula. Data will be analyzed per the intention to treat. This will be the first, large, and well-designed RCT that aims to determine whether EN is beneficial for patients who underwent PD under the ERAS protocol. According to the results of this study, either EN or PPN would be adopted as the standard nutritional support for patients undergoing PD. jRCT1030210691. Registered on March 23, 2022. ",

        "AbstractText": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is a common disease in men over 65 years of age, and should be detected early, while reducing unnecessary biopsies. This study aims to construct a classification and regression tree (CART) model (i.e., risk stratification algorithm) using multivariable approach to select Vietnamese men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) for PCa biopsy. We conducted a case-control study on 260 men aged&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;50 years who visited MEDIC Medical Center, Vietnam in 2017-2018 with self-reported LUTS. The case group included patients with a positive biopsy and the control group included patients with a negative biopsy diagnosis of PCa. Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) was used for selecting the most parsimonious prediction model. Then the CART with 5-fold cross-validation was constructed for selecting men who can benefit from PCa biopsy in steps by steps and intuitive way. BMA suggested five potential prediction models, in which the most parsimonious model including PSA, I-PSS, and age. CART advised the following cut-off points in the marked screening sequence: 18&#8201;<&#8201;PSA&#8201;<&#8201;33.5 ng/mL, I-PSS&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;19, and age&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;71.

Growing evidence point to a link to Mediator complex subunit 12 (MED12) and DNA damage repair (DDR) and TGF-&#946; signing, while the clinical data on the association of MED12 and ICIs response are lacking. In this study, clinical and whole-exome sequencing (WES) data from published studies were merged as a WES cohort to explore the association between MED12 mutation (MED12-Mut) and ICIs efficiency across cancers. Then, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) cohort was used for validating our findings. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort was used to perform anti-tumor immunity and prognosis analysis. In the WES cohort (n&#8201;=&#8201;474), significant differences were detected between MED12-Mut and MED12-wildtype (MED12-Wt) patients regarding durable clinical benefit (DCB, 80.00% vs. 53.67%, P&#8201;=&#8201;0.022).

In the MSKCC cohort (n&#8201;=&#8201;1513), overall survival advantage was achieved in MED12-Mut patients (mOS: 41 vs. 19&#160;months, HR:0.54, 95%CI 0.34-0.85; log-rank P&#8201;=&#8201;0.007), after taking into account same factors in WES cohort, this link still existed (HR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.38-0.96, P&#8201;=&#8201;0.033), Notably, TMB was also found significantly higher in MED12-Mut patients in both WES and MSKCC cohort. Further tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and DDR-related gene analysis revealed anti-tumor immunity in MED12-Mut patients. Totally, MED12-Mut successfully predicted better clinical outcomes in ICIs-treated pan-cancer cohort, indicating that MED12-Mut could serve as a potential predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitors in pan-cancer.

        "AbstractText": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed human malignancies. Ribosomal protein L31 (RPL31, aka eL31) is a component of the 60S large ribosomal subunit, and its expression pattern and functional role in CRC have not been reported. Herein, we identified that eL31 protein level was dramatically increased in CRC tissues through using IHC analysis. More notably, elevated eL31 was associated with larger tumor size and shorter overall survival. Besides, we evaluated the effects of eL31 depletion on CRC cell phenotypes in vitro. The data indicated that eL31 knockdown restricted CRC cell proliferation, migration and colony formation whilst enhancing cell apoptosis. Importantly, eL31 was also essential for CRC tumor growth in vivo, as demonstrated by impaired tumor growth markers and reduced Ki67 levels in xenografts from eL31-depleted cells. In addition, our evidence indicated that DEP domain containing 1 (DEPDC1) was a potential downstream target of eL31 in regulating CRC. Consistently, DEPDC1 depletion restrained CRC cell proliferation and migration, as well as facilitated cell apoptosis. More interestingly, DEPDC1 depletion could reverse the promotion effects of eL31 elevation on CRC cells. Identification of eL31's function in CRC may pave the way for future development of more specific and more effective targeted therapy strategies against CRC. ",

To assess the impact of self-reported awareness and attitudes on vaccination practices, and the perception on self-sampling for cervical cancer screening. A 12-month survey using purposive sampling of females attending an urban public university was conducted. SPSS version 25 was used to compare the responses for students enrolled in health vs non-health related programmes. Of the 290 questionnaires distributed, 240 were returned (response rate&#8201;=&#8201;83%) in approximately equal proportion from the faculties of Health Science and Pharmacy (n&#8201;=&#8201;127), and from the Hotel and Tourism, Business Management, and Art and Design (n&#8201;=&#8201;113) faculties. About one-third (28.8%) had completed 3 shots, 19.6% received the first shot, 11.4% had scheduled appointments for first shots while 40.2% were both unvaccinated and had not scheduled any appointment. Most (71%) were aware of the HPV vaccines while 50.5% were unaware that HPV vaccines were also available for men. Students enrolled in health-related programmes were 3.2 times more perceptive to the benefits of vaccination particularly in preventing spread to their partners (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.3-3.41, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.006) than their counterparts. A weak-positive correlation was observed between knowledge and vaccination practices (r&#8201;=&#8201;0.2, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.001). The level of knowledge on HPV and its vaccine was greater for health-related (Mdn&#8201;=&#8201;6.5) than for students of non-health related (Mdn&#8201;=&#8201;1.5) programmes (U&#8201;=&#8201;2790.5, p-value&#8201;=&#8201;0.00). Attitudes towards immunisation were influenced by perceived benefits versus risks for side effects, cost barriers, and influences of primarily their doctors and parents. The study was limited in that relationship statuses were used to estimate sexual history as direct questions were unanswered in the pilot survey. HPV vaccine uptake for an immunisation-targeted young female population is low despite moderate knowledge levels. It is plausible that the low rates among females enrolled in particularly the non-health programmes were impacted by misperceived vaccine-associated risks, and misconception that testing and vaccination for HPV and cervical cancer were for those married or sexually active. Self-sampling could offer a potential alternative to sampling via pelvic examination, particularly for societies where premarital sex is seen as a taboo. ",

        "AbstractText": "Exosome mediated mRNA delivery is a promising strategy for the treatment of multiple diseases. However, the low yield of exosomes is a bottleneck for clinical translation. In this study, we boosted exosome production via simultaneously reducing the expression of genes inhibiting exosome biogenesis and supplementing the culture medium with red cell membrane components. Among the candidate genes, knocking down of Rab4 was identified to have the highest efficacy in promoting exosome biogenesis while without any obvious cytotoxicity. Additionally, supplementing red cell membrane particles (RCMPs) in the culture medium further promoted exosome production. Combination of Rab4 knockdown and RCMP supplement increased exosome yield up to 14-fold. As a proof-of-concept study, low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr) mRNA was forced expressed in the exosome donor cells and passively encapsulated into the exosomes during biogenesis with this strategy. Though exosome production per cell increased, the booster strategy didn't alter the loading efficiency of therapeutic Ldlr mRNA per exosome. Consistently, the therapeutic exosomes derived by the strategy alleviated liver steatosis and atherosclerosis in Ldlr-/- mice, similar as the exosomes produced by routine methods. Together, the proposed exosome booster strategy conquers the low yield bottleneck to some extent and would certainly facilitate the clinical translation of exosomes. ",

        "AbstractText": "It has been previously reported that CD155 is often over-expressed in a variety of cancer types. In fact, it is known to be involved in cancer development, and its role in cancer has been widely established. However, clinical and mechanistic studies involving CD155 yielded conflicting results. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate overall prognostic value of CD155 in cancer patients, using a comprehensive analysis. Online databases were searched, data was collected, and clinical value of CD155 was evaluated by combining hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs). The present study involved meta-analysis of 26 previous studies that involved 4325 cancer patients. These studies were obtained from 25 research articles. The results of the study revealed that increased CD155 expression was significantly associated with reduced OS in patients with cancer as compared to low CD155 expression (pooled HR = 1.772, 95% CI = 1.441-2.178, P < 0.001). Furthermore, subgroup analysis demonstrated that the level of CD155 expression was significantly associated with OS in patients with digestive system cancer (pooled HR = 1.570, 95% CI = 1.120-2.201, P = 0.009), hepatobiliary pancreatic cancer (pooled HR = 1.677, 95% CI = 1.037-2.712, P = 0.035), digestive tract cancer (pooled HR = 1.512, 95% CI = 1.016-2.250, P = 0.042), breast cancer (pooled HR = 2.137, 95% CI = 1.448-3.154, P < 0.001), lung cancer (pooled HR = 1.706, 95% CI = 1.193-2.440, P = 0.003), head and neck cancer (pooled HR = 1.470, 95% CI = 1.160-1.862, P = 0.001).

The m6A-immune-related lncRNAs were identified using univariate Cox regression analysis and Pearson correlation analysis. A risk model was established using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analyses, and analyzed using nomogram, time-dependent receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The differences in infiltration scores, clinical features, and sensitivity to Talazoparib of various immune cells between low- and high-risk groups were investigated. Totally 618 m6A-immune-related lncRNAs and 490 immune-related lncRNAs were identified from TCGA, and 47 lncRNAs of their intersection demonstrated prognostic values. A risk model with 11 lncRNAs was established by Lasso Cox regression, and can predict the prognosis of bladder cancer patients as demonstrated by time-dependent ROC and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Significant correlations were determined between risk score and tumor malignancy or immune cell infiltration. Meanwhile, significant differences were observed in tumor mutation burden and stemness-score between the low-risk group and high-risk group. Moreover, high-risk group patients were more responsive to Talazoparib.

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) can be recruited into osteosarcoma tissue and affect the progression by secreting exosomes. However, whether BMSCs derived exosomes transmit XIST to regulate the growth and metastasis of osteosarcoma and the related mechanism are still unclear. In this study, BMSCs derived exosomes were used to treat human osteosarcoma cells MG63 and 143B, and the level of XIST in BMSCs was intervened by siRNA. CCK-8, EdU, transwell assays were used to analyze the changes of cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Bioinformatics analysis, RNA pulldown and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays validated the targeted relationship of XIST with miR-655 and the interaction between miR-655 and ACLY 3'-UTR. 143B/LUC cell line was used to establish an animal model of in situ osteosarcoma to verify the found effects of XIST on osteosarcoma. Oil Red O staining, Western blot and so on were used to detect the changes of lipid deposition and protein expression. It was found that BMSCs derived exosomes promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells, and the down-regulation of XIST inhibited this effect. miR-655 mediated the role of BMSCs derived exosomal XIST in promoting the progression of osteosarcoma and down-regulation of miR-655 could reverse the effects of inhibiting XIST on the proliferation, migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells. Meanwhile, animal level results confirmed that BMSCs derived exosomal XIST could promote osteosarcoma growth and lung metastasis by combining with miR-655. In-depth mechanism study showed that BMSCs derived exosomal XIST combined with miR-655 to increase the protein level of ACLY, which led to lipid deposition and activate &#946;-catenin signal to promote the proliferation, migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells. This study showed that BMSCs derived exosomal XIST could enter osteosarcoma cells, bind and down-regulates the level of miR-655, resulting in an increase in the level of ACLY, thus increasing the lipid deposition and the activity of &#946;-catenin signal to promote the growth and metastasis of osteosarcoma.

        "AbstractText": "Empirical estimates of health system opportunity costs have been suggested as a basis for the cost-effectiveness threshold to use in Health Technology Assessment. Econometric methods have been used to estimate these in several countries based on data on spending and mortality. This study examines empirical evidence on four issues: non-linearity of the relationship between spending and mortality; the inclusion of outcomes other than mortality; variation in the efficiency with which expenditures generate health outcomes; and the relationship among efficiency, mortality rates and outcome elasticities. Quantile Regression is used to examine non-linearities in the relationship between mortality and health expenditures along the mortality distribution. Data Envelopment Analysis extends the approach, using multiple measures of health outcomes to measure efficiency. These are applied to health expenditure data from 151 geographical units (Primary Care Trusts) of the National Health Service in England, across eight different clinical areas (Programme Budget Categories), for 3 fiscal years from 2010/11 to 2012/13. The results suggest differences in efficiency levels across geographical units and clinical areas as to how health resources generate outcomes, which indicates the capacity to adjust to a decrease in health expenditure without affecting health outcomes. Moreover, efficient units have lower absolute levels of mortality elasticity to health expenditure than inefficient ones. The policy of adopting thresholds based on estimates of a single system-wide cost-effectiveness threshold assumes a relationship between expenditure and health outcomes that generates an opportunity cost estimate which applies to the whole system. Our evidence of variations in that relationship and therefore in opportunity costs suggests that adopting a single threshold may exacerbate the efficiency and equity concerns that such thresholds are designed to counter. In most health care systems, many decisions about provision are not made centrally. Our analytical approach to understanding variability in opportunity cost can help policy makers target efficiency improvements and set realistic targets for local and clinical area health improvements from increased expenditure.

        "AbstractText": "Breast cancer clinics across the UK have long been struggling to cope with high demand. Novel risk prediction tools - such as the PinPoint test - could help to reduce unnecessary clinic referrals. Using early data on the expected accuracy of the test, we explore the potential impact of PinPoint on: (a) the percentage of patients meeting the two-week referral target, and (b) the number of clinic 'overspill' appointments generated (i.e. patients having to return to the clinic to complete their required investigations). A simulation model was built to reflect the annual flow of patients through a single UK clinic. Due to current uncertainty around the exact impact of PinPoint testing on standard care, two primary scenarios were assessed. Scenario 1 assumed complete GP adherence to testing, with only non-referred cancerous cases returning for delayed referral. Scenario 2 assumed GPs would overrule 20% of low-risk results, and that 10% of non-referred non-cancerous cases would also return for delayed referral. A range of sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of key uncertainties on the model results. Service reconfiguration scenarios, removing individual weekly clinics from the clinic schedule, were also explored. Under standard care, 66.3% (95% CI: 66.0 to 66.5) of patients met the referral target, with 1,685 (1,648 to 1,722) overspill appointments. Under both PinPoint scenarios, >&#8201;98% of patients met the referral target, with overspill appointments reduced to between 727 (707 to 746) [Scenario 1] and 886 (861 to 911) [Scenario 2]. The reduced clinic demand was sufficient to allow removal of one weekly low-capacity clinic [N&#8201;=&#8201;10], and the results were robust to sensitivity analyses. The findings from this early analysis indicate that risk prediction tools could have the potential to alleviate pressure on cancer clinics, and are expected to have increased utility in the wake of heightened pressures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research is required to validate these findings with real world evidence; evaluate the broader clinical and economic impact of the test; and to determine outcomes and risks for patients deemed to be low-risk on the PinPoint test and therefore not initially referred.

Although age-related macular degeneration was initially the most common target of intravitreal injection of VEGFIs, it has also been applied sporadically for diabetic macular edema in recent years. Proteinuria following intravitreal injection of VEGFIs would be reversible. In patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), however, it would be difficult to determine whether kidney damage arises from the clinical course of DM or from intravitreal injection of VEGFIs for diabetic macular edema. A 55-year-old woman with a 20-year history of type 2 DM began intravitreal injection of VEGFI (aflibercept, 2&#160;mg every 4&#160;weeks) for treatment of diabetic macular edema 2&#160;years previously. She presented with leg edema, hypertension, and nephrotic-range proteinuria 14&#160;months after the first injection. Histological examination of renal biopsy specimens revealed diabetic nephropathy with renal thrombotic microangiopathy probably associated with intravitreal injection of VEGFI. The patient's nephrotic syndrome completely improved at 6&#160;months after simply discontinuing aflibercept. This is a precious report of pathologically investigated renal thrombotic microangiopathy leading to nephrotic syndrome due to intravitreal injection of aflibercept for diabetic macular edema in a patient with type 2 DM. Renal function and proteinuria should be monitored in diabetic patients who receive intravitreal injection of a VEGFI. If kidney damage develops independent of the clinical course of DM during intravitreal injection of a VEGFI, renal biopsy should be performed and intravitreal VEGFI injection discontinued. ",

We used a soft, inexpensive gauze pad band pulling the rectal tube to analyze the effect of surgery. A gauze pad band was positioned at the proximal of the tumor, followed by fastening the rectal tube and ligating the rectum. 233 patients undergoing laparoscopic anterior resection for mid to low rectal cancer were enrolled between January 2018 and December 2020. After propensity score matching, 63 cases were selected in gauze pad band group and 126 cases were selected in traditional group. The two groups were compared in preoperative, intraoperative, and pathological characteristics. Compared to traditional group, the median operation duration (203&#160;min vs. 233&#160;min, p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001) and the median intraoperative bleeding (48&#160;ml vs. 67&#160;ml, p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001) were lesser in gauze pad band group.

        "AbstractText": "Lung cancers arising in never smokers have been suggested to be substantially different from lung cancers in smokers at an epidemiological, genetic and molecular level. Focusing on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we characterized lung cancer patients in China looking for demographic and clinical differences between the smoking and never-smoking subgroups. In total, 891 patients with NSCLC, including 841 with adenocarcinoma and 50 with squamous cell carcinoma, were recruited in this study. Association of smoking status with demographic and clinical features of NSCLC was determined, and risk factors for lymph node metastasis and TNM stage were evaluated using Multivariate logistic regression analysis. In patients with adenocarcinoma, never smokers showed a younger age at diagnosis (54.2&#8201;&#177;&#8201;12.7vs. 59.3&#8201;&#177;&#8201;9.4, padjusted<0.001), a lower risk for lymph node metastasis than smokers (7,6% vs. 19.5%, padjusted<0.001) and less severe disease as indicated by lower percentages of patients with TNM stage of III or IV (5.5% vs. 14.7%, padjusted<0.001 ). By contrast, these associations were not observed in 50 patients with squamous cell carcinoma. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that smoking status was a risk factor for lymph node metastasis (OR&#8201;=&#8201;2.70, 95% CI: 1.39-5.31, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.004) but not for TNM stage (OR&#8201;=&#8201;1.18, 95% CI: 0.09-14.43, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.896) in adenocarcinoma.

        "AbstractText": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a global health problem with regional differences in epidemiological statistics. Co-assembling the drug nanoparticles and targeting moieties could improve the therapeutic delivery of anti-cancer drugs. In this attempt, we tracked the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in HCC cells using viramidine (VRM)-loaded aptamer (APT) nanoparticles. In these NPs, both APT and VRM act as targeted ligands/drugs to HCC cells. The NPs were characterized using TEM, ESI-MS, FTIR, and 1H NMR. The results showed uniform particles with round and smooth shapes on the nano-scale. SRB-based cytotoxicity was performed and IC50 values were measured for HCC versus normal cells upon the proposed treatments. The flow cytometry technique was applied to determine apoptosis, then confirmed using genetic and protein analyses. In addition, nitric oxide (NO) and its enzyme (iNOS) were analyzed to examine the effect of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) on apoptosis induction. The present findings indicated that Huh-7 cells were more sensitive to APT-VRM NPs than HepG2 cells, recording the lowest IC50 values (11.23&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.23&#160;&#181;M and 16.69&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1.12&#160;&#181;M), as well as the highest significant increase in the apoptotic cells (61.5% and 42%), respectively. Intriguingely, normal BHK-21 cells recorded undetectable IC50 values in the applied NPs, confirming their targeted delivery ability. The genetic expression and protein levels of c-FLIP, Bcl-2, and TNF-&#945; were down-regulated, while FADD, caspase 8, caspase 3, caspase 9, and Bax were up-regulated upon treatment with APT-VRM NPs. The prepared VRM NPs labeled with APT could significantly elevate NO via activation of iNOS. In conclusion, APT-VRM NPs bioconjugate interferes with HCC cells through NO-mediated extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis. ",

        "AbstractText": "AZD0156 is an oral inhibitor of ATM, a serine threonine kinase that plays a key role in DNA damage response (DDR) associated with double-strand breaks. Topoisomerase-I inhibitor irinotecan is used clinically to treat colorectal cancer (CRC), often in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5FU). AZD0156 in combination with irinotecan and 5FU was evaluated in preclinical models of CRC to determine whether low doses of AZD0156 enhance the cytotoxicity of irinotecan in chemotherapy regimens used in the clinic. Anti-proliferative effects of single-agent AZD0156, the active metabolite of irinotecan (SN38), and combination therapy were evaluated in 12 CRC cell lines. Additional assessment with clonogenic assay, cell cycle analysis, and immunoblotting were performed in 4 selected cell lines. Four colorectal cancer patient derived xenograft (PDX) models were treated with AZD0156, irinotecan, or 5FU alone and in combination for assessment of tumor growth inhibition (TGI). Immunofluorescence was performed on tumor tissues. The DDR mutation profile was compared across in vitro and in vivo models. Enhanced effects on cellular proliferation and regrowth were observed with the combination of AZD0156 and SN38 in select models. In cell cycle analysis of these models, increased G2/M arrest was observed with combination treatment over either single agent. Immunoblotting results suggest an increase in DDR associated with irinotecan therapy, with a reduced effect noted when combined with AZD0156, which is more pronounced in some models. Increased TGI was observed with the combination of AZD0156 and irinotecan as compared to single-agent therapy in some PDX models. The DDR mutation profile was variable across models. AZD0156 and irinotecan provide a rational and active combination in preclinical colorectal cancer models. Variability across in vivo and in vitro results may be related to the variable DDR mutation profiles of the models evaluated. Further understanding of the implications of individual DDR mutation profiles may help better identify patients more likely to benefit from treatment with the combination of AZD0156 and irinotecan in the clinical setting.

        "AbstractText": "This meta-analysis compared the quality of lung collapse and the resultant adverse reactions between the use of double-lumen endotracheal tubes (DLT) and bronchial blockers (BB) in minimally invasive thoracic surgery. A search was performed in five bibliographic databases, namely PubMed, Springer, Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library ignoring the original language, which identified five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published on or before December 31, 2021. These studies were subsequently analyzed. All included studies compared the efficacy and safety of DLT and BB as a lung isolation technique in surgery. The methodological quality of each study was assessed by the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool. The quality of lung collapse and the malposition rate were adopted as the main outcome indicators. Alternatively, the intubation time and the incidence of postoperative sore throat were adopted as secondary indicators. When either DLT or BB were utilized in minimally invasive thoracic surgery, no differences were observed in the quality of lung collapse (odds ratio [OR], 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 1.58), the intubation time (mean difference [MD], 0.06; 95% CI, -1.02 to 1.14), or the malposition rate (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.37 to 2.06). However, the incidence of postoperative sore throat among patients treated with BB was significantly lower than that among patients treated with DLT (OR, 5.25; 95% CI, 2.55 to 10.75). When utilized in minimally invasive thoracic surgery, the quality of lung collapse with DLT was identical to that with BB. However, patients treated with the latter demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of postoperative sore throat. ",

        "AbstractText": "Compositional systems, represented as parts of some whole, are ubiquitous. They encompass the abundances of proteins in a cell, the distribution of organisms in nature, and the stoichiometry of the most basic chemical reactions. Thus, a central goal is to understand how such processes emerge from the behaviors of their components and their pairwise interactions. Such a study, however, is challenging for two key reasons. Firstly, such systems are complex and depend, often stochastically, on their constituent parts. Secondly, the data lie on a simplex which influences their correlations. To resolve both of these issues, we provide a general and data-driven modeling tool for compositional systems called Compositional Maximum Entropy (CME). By integrating the prior geometric structure of compositions with sample-specific information, CME infers the underlying multivariate relationships between the constituent components. We provide two proofs of principle. First, we measure the relative abundances of different bacteria and infer how they interact. Second, we show that our method outperforms a common alternative for the extraction of gene-gene interactions in triple-negative breast cancer. CME provides novel and biologically-intuitive insights and is promising as a comprehensive quantitative framework for compositional data. ",

As recent data-driven respiratory gating (DDG) [18F]-FDG has shown superior diagnostic performance in lung cancer, we evaluated the impact of DDG on the reproducibility of radiomics features derived from [18F]-FDG PET/CT in comparison to free-breathing flow (FB) imaging. Twenty four lung nodules from 20 patients were delineated. Radiomics features were derived on FB flow PET/CT and on the corresponding DDG reconstruction using the QuantImage v2 platform. Lin's concordance factor (Cb) and the mean difference percentage (DIFF%) were calculated for each radiomics feature using the delineated nodules which were also classified by anatomical localisation and volume. Non-reproducible radiomics features were defined as having a bias correction factor Cb&#8201; < 0.8 and/or a mean difference percentage DIFF%&#8201;>&#8201;10. In total 141 features were computed on each concordance analysis, 10 of which were non-reproducible on all pulmonary lesions. Those were first-order features from Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)-filtered images (sigma&#8201;=&#8201;1&#160;mm): Energy, Kurtosis, Minimum, Range, Root Mean Squared, Skewness and Variance; Texture features from Gray Level Cooccurence Matrix (GLCM): Cluster Prominence and Difference Variance; First-order Standardised Uptake Value (SUV) feature: Kurtosis. Pulmonary lesions located in the superior lobes had only stable radiomics features, the ones from the lower parts had 25 non-reproducible radiomics features. Pulmonary lesions with a greater size (defined as long axis length&#8201;>&#8201;median) showed a higher reproducibility (9 non-reproducible features) than smaller ones (20 non-reproducible features). Calculated on all pulmonary lesions, 131 out of 141 radiomics features can be used interchangeably between DDG and FB PET/CT acquisitions.

MDM2 is ubiquitously expressed, with its overexpression implicated in many forms of cancer. The inhibitory effects of MDM2 on p53 have been shown to involve its N-terminal p53-binding domain and its C-terminal RING domain. The presence of an intact central acidic domain of MDM2 has also been shown to regulate p53 ubiquitination, with this domain shown to directly interact with the p53 DNA-binding domain to regulate the DNA binding activity of p53. To date, little structural information has been obtained for the MDM2 acidic domain. Thus, to gain insight into the structure and function relationship of this region, we have applied solution-state NMR spectroscopy to characterize the segment of MDM2 spanning residues 215-300. These boundaries for the acidic domain were determined on the basis of consensus observed in multiple sequence alignment.

The capability of migration and invasion was evaluated by wound healing assay and Boyden-chamber assay. The mRNA and protein expression of EMT markers was respectively detected by qPCR and western blot. We detected NRF2 occupancy at the miR-27a promoter by ChIP-Seq analysis. Meanwhile, the luciferase assay verified BUB1 as a direct target of miR-27a. We found hypoxia promotes lung cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process by inhibiting the miR-27a expression. miR-27a mimics significantly reduced the promotion effect of hypoxia on the invasion and proliferation of lung cancer cells. NRF2 as regulating the oxidation/anti-oxidation factor was activated under hypoxia conditions. The activation of NRF2 repressed miR-27a expression. On the contrary, the inhibitory effect of hypoxia on miR-27a was reversed when the NFE2L2 gene was silenced. Ectopic expression of NRF2 inhibited miR-27a expression under normoxia.

The level of the STAMBP protein in noncancerous and tumor tissues of breast cancer patients was examined by immunohistochemical staining. The expression of STAMBP mRNA in tissues based on healthy individual and breast cancer patient data in the TCGA database was evaluated. The association between the expression of STAMBP mRNA and clinical features and prognosis was evaluated using TCGA database.

Activation of the ERK signaling was detected by Western blotting. The expression of STAMBP was markedly upregulated in the cytoplasm of tumor cells from breast cancer patients. The level of STAMBP was closely associated with the tumor subtype and size and the TNM stage of the breast cancer patients. Importantly, high expression of STAMBP predicted poor overall survival (OS) for breast cancer patients. Furthermore, knockdown of STAMBP expression reduced cell mobility and invasion of breast cancer cells. Notably, the phosphorylation of EGFR and ERK was markedly reduced in STAMBP-knockdown cells.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are present in PM10, such as benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), which is a well-known genotoxic and carcinogenic compound to humans, capable of activating AP-1 transcription factor family genes through the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR). Because effects of BaP include metalloprotease 9 (MMP-9) activation, cell invasion, and other pathways related to carcinogenesis, we aimed to demonstrate that PM10 (10&#160;&#181;g/cm2) exposure induces the activation of AP-1 family members as well as cell invasion in lung epithelial cells, through AhR pathway. The role of the AhR gene in cells exposed to PM10 (10&#160;&#181;g/cm2) and BaP (1&#181;M) for 48&#160;h was evaluated using AhR-targeted interference siRNA. Then, the AP-1 family members (c-Jun, Jun B, Jun D, Fos B, C-Fos, and Fra-1), the levels/activity of MMP-9, and cell invasion were analyzed. We found that PM10 increased AhR levels and promoted its nuclear localization in A549 treated cells. Also, PM10 and BaP deregulated the activity of AP-1 family members. Moreover, PM10 upregulated the secretion and activity of MMP-9 through AhR, while BaP had no effect. Finally, we found that cell invasion in A549 cells exposed to PM10 and BaP is modulated by AhR. Our results demonstrated that PM10 exposure induces upregulation of the c-Jun, Jun B, and Fra-1 activity, the expression/activity of MMP-9, and the cell invasion in lung epithelial cells, effects mediated through the AhR. Also, the Fos B and C-Fos activity were downregulated.

The cytotoxic activity of Ketoprofen was assayed by the MTS method. Flowcytometry was utilized to measure the number of apoptotic MDA-MB-231 cells. The expression levels of apoptosis and autophagy markers, JAK2 and STAT3 were determined using quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting methods. Ketoprofen significantly decreased the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells compared to control cells. It also considerably induced apoptosis and apoptotic markers in these cells in comparison to controls. Treating the MADA-MB-231 cell line with Ketoprofen had an inhibitory effect on autophagy markers in this cell line. The use of FasL, as a death ligand, and ZB4, as an antibody that blocks the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, revealed the involvement of the extrinsic pathway in the apoptosis-stimulating effect of Ketoprofen in the MADA-MB-231 cell line. Ketoprofen also hindered the phosphorylation and activation of JAK2 and STAT molecules leading to the inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway in this TNBC cell line. The outcomes of this study uncovered the anti-TNBC activity of Ketoprofen by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting viability and autophagy in MADA-MB-231 cells.

Further analysis was performed, and a random effect modeling showed a pooled local-regional failure rate of 41.4% (95% CI 32.2-50.8), and a pooled distant failure rate of 21.6% (95% CI 17.0-26.5). The included studies used a median radiotherapy (RT) dose of 61.2&#160;Gy (95% CI 60.0-62.0, range 56.0-66.0), but we measured a non-significant impact of the RT dose on the pooled overall survival (OS), suggesting that an increased RT dose might not be related to an improved OS (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.23). Further research should be conducted to define predictors and prognostic categories that may select the best treatment option for each patient. ",

        "AbstractText": "Achieving new contrast enhancer agents that can produce high-resolution images in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a minimum dose and side effects has always been important. Herein, the pegylated curcumin-coated manganese-zinc ferrite nanoparticles (MZF@CA-PEG-CUR NPs) have been reported as an MR imaging nanoprobe in hepatocellular carcinoma detection in the murine model for the first time.&#160;In vitro&#160;studies were done on HEPA 1-6 cancer cells and L929 as normal cells, and&#160;in vivo&#160;studies were done on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using xenograft models of HCC. The prepared NP had a diameter of 105&#160;nm with narrow size distribution and was superparamagnetic with a saturated magnetization (Ms) of 39&#160;emu/g. The NP was biocompatible without any significant hemolysis and cytotoxicity. Prussian blue staining showed more cellular uptake of HEPA 1-6 compared to L929 control cells after incubation (P&#8201;<&#8201;0.05). The concentration of Fe in mice blood confirmed the plasma half-life of about 3&#160;h; it seems the PEGylation increased the circulation time. ICP-OES of Fe showed the highest tumor localization for MZF@CA-CUR-PEG NPs, due to passive accumulation, compared to the other mice studied organs. The r2 relaxivity of NPs was 134.89&#160;mM-&#160;1&#160;s-&#160;1, and&#160;in vitro&#160;MRI demonstrated better effects in HEPA 1-6 cells than in L929 (P&#8201;<&#8201;0.05). Also,&#160;in vivo&#160;MR images showed signal enhancement efficacy in tumor-bearing mice. This study demonstrated that the MZF@CA-CUR-PEG nanoprobe could be a promising candidate as an MR imaging agent in hepatocellular carcinoma early detection. ",

        "AbstractText": "Terminal differentiation failure is an important cause of rhabdomyosarcoma genesis, however, little is known about the epigenetic regulation of aberrant myogenic differentiation. Here, we show that GATA-4 recruits polycomb group proteins such as EZH2 to negatively regulate miR-29a in undifferentiated C2C12 myoblast cells, whereas recruitment of GRIP-1 to GATA-4 proteins displaces EZH2, resulting in the activation of miR-29a during myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells. Moreover, in poorly differentiated rhabdomyosarcoma cells, EZH2 still binds to the miR-29a promoter with GATA-4 to mediate transcriptional repression of miR-29a. Interestingly, once re-differentiation of rhabdomyosarcoma cells toward skeletal muscle, EZH2 was dispelled from miR-29a promoter which is similar to that in myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells. Eventually, this expression of miR-29a results in limited rhabdomyosarcoma cell proliferation and promotes myogenic differentiation. We thus establish that GATA-4 can function as a molecular switch in the up- and downregulation of miR-29a expression. We also demonstrate that GATA-4 acts as a tumor suppressor in rhabdomyosarcoma partly via miR-29a, which thus provides a potential therapeutic target for rhabdomyosarcoma. ",

In TP53 wild-type malignancies, therapy with small molecule antagonists of MDM2 results in antileukemic activity. Current treatment strategies, however, have been limited by poor tolerability and incomplete clinical activity. We have developed a proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) MS3227 that targets MDM2 by recruiting the E3 ligase Von Hippel-Lindau, resulting in proteasome-dependent degradation of MDM2. In WT TP53 leukemia cell lines, MS3227 led to activation of p53 targets p21, PUMA, and MDM2 and resulted in cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and decreased viability. The catalytic PROTAC MS3227 led to more potent activation when compared to a stoichiometric inhibitor, in part by dampening the negative feedback mechanism in the p53 - MDM2 circuit. The effectiveness of MS3227 was also observed in primary patient specimens with selectivity towards leukemic blasts. The addition of MS3227 enhanced the activity of other anti-leukemic agents including azacytidine, cytarabine, and venetoclax. In particular, MS3227 treatment was shown to downregulate MCL-1, a known mediator of resistance to venetoclax. A PROTAC-based approach may provide a means of improving MDM2 inhibition to gain greater therapeutic potential in AML. ",

        "AbstractText": "The treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has been a model for cancer therapy development. Though most patients with CML have a normal quality and duration of life with TKI therapy, some patients progress to accelerated phase (AP) and blast phase (BP), both of which have a relatively poor prognosis. The rates of progression have reduced significantly from over >20% in the pre-TKI era to <5% now, largely due to refinements in CML therapy and response monitoring. Significant insights have been gained into the mechanisms of disease transformation including the role of additional cytogenetic abnormalities, somatic mutations, and other genomic alterations present at diagnosis or evolving on therapy. This knowledge is helping to optimize TKI therapy, improve prognostication and inform the development of novel combination regimens in these patients. While patients with de novo CML-AP have outcomes almost similar to CML in chronic phase (CP), those transformed from previously treated CML-CP should receive second- or third- generation TKIs and be strongly considered for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Similarly, patients with transformed CML-BP have particularly dismal outcomes with a median survival usually less than one year. Combination regimens with a potent TKI such as ponatinib followed by allo-SCT can achieve long-term survival in some transformed BP patients. Regimens including venetoclax in myeloid BP or inotuzumab ozogamicin or blinatumomab in lymphoid BP might lead to deeper and longer responses, facilitating potentially curative allo-SCT for patients with CML-BP once CP is achieved. Newer agents and novel combination therapies are further expanding the therapeutic arsenal in advanced phase CML. ",

        "AbstractText": "Endoscopic resection or esophagectomy has becoming the standard treatment for superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (SESCC), but some patients may develop disease progression or second primary cancers after the therapies. Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR), and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) reflect the balance between pro-cancer inflammatory and anti-cancer immune responses, however their roles in SESCC are still unknown. We consecutively enrolled patients with newly diagnosed SESCC (clinical stage Tis or T1N0M0) who were treated at our institute. Pre-treatment NLR, LMR and PLR were assessed and then correlated with clinical factors and long-term survival. A total of 156 patients were enrolled (152 males, 4 females; median age: 52.2&#160;years), of whom 104 received endoscopic resection and 52 were treated with esophagectomy or chemoradiation.. During a mean follow-up period of 60.1&#160;months, seventeen patients died of ESCCs, and 45 died of second primary cancers. The 5-year ESCC-specific survival and 5-year overall survival rate were 86% and 57%, respectively. LMR (P&#8201;<&#8201;0.05) and NLR (P&#8201;<&#8201;0.05), but not PLR were significantly correlated with overall survival. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed optimal LMR and NLR cut-off values of 4 and 2.5, respectively, to predict a poor prognosis. Patients with a high NLR or low LMR tended to have longer tumor length, larger circumferential extension, and presence of second primary cancers. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that presence of second primary cancers (HR: 5.05, 95%CI: 2.75-9.28), low LMR (HR: 2.56, 95%CI: 1.09-6.03) were independent risk factors for poor survival. A low pre-treatment LMR may be a non-invasive pretreatment predictor of poor prognosis to guide the surveillance program, suggesting that anti-cancer immunity may play a role in the early events of esophageal squamous cancer.

All studies were conducted under a research protocol approved by the National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center, Animal Care and Use Committee. BALB/cJ mice were inoculated with CT26 cells, and randomized to RFA, CRA, or sham treatment. Mice were sacrificed 3&#160;days post-treatment, and tumor, spleen, and serum were harvested. Cell death was determined by Caspase-3 immunohistochemical and TUNEL stains. Immune response was analyzed using flow cytometry, serum cytokine assay and immunohistochemistry. Cell death, necrosis, and apoptosis induced by ablation were comparable in RFA and CRA. Decreased frequency of systemic T-regulatory cells was found in the CRA group. Both RFA and CRA reduced frequencies of several myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) subpopulations. RFA induced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion including TNF-&#945; and IL-12 as well as anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-5, and IL-10. CRA augmented secretion of a wider array of cytokines compared to RFA with both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties including IL-1&#946;, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and KC GRO. In the tumor microenvironment, RFA reduced the number of T-regulatory cells, a finding not observed with CRA. Reduction of immune suppression via decreases in T-regulatory cells and MDSC was found to be induced by RFA or CRA. CRA augmented a wider range of cytokines than RFA, which were mainly pro-inflammatory, but also anti-inflammatory. In the tumor microenvironment, RFA demonstrated more pronounced anti-tumoral immunity. Further delineation of specific immunomodulation induced by ablation could inform drug-device development and may play a role in future hypothesis-driven immunomodulatory paradigms that combine immunotherapy drugs with tumor destruction for the treatment of metastatic colon cancer.

Previously, we identified the high levels of sphingolipids, ceramide phosphates and sphingosine phosphates, and the genes involved in their synthesis, CERK and SPHK1, in breast cancer patients. The present study aimed to determine the correlations of CERK and SPHK1 with clinical outcomes as well as metastasis and drug resistance markers. Both local and TCGA cohorts were analysed. High-confidence regulatory interaction network was constructed to find association of target genes with metastasis and drug resistance. Furthermore, correlations of CERK and SPHK1 with selected metastasis and drug resistance markers were validated in both cohorts. Overexpression of CERK and SPHK1 was associated with nodal metastasis, late tumor stage and high proliferation potency. In addition, increased CERK expression was also indicative of poor patient survival. Computational network analysis revealed the association of CERK and SPHK1 with known metastasis markers MMP-2 and MMP-9 and drug resistance markers ABCC1 and ABCG2. Correlation analysis confirmed the associations of target genes with these markers in both local as well as TCGA cohort. The above findings suggest clinical utility of CERK and SPHK1 as potential biomarkers in breast cancer patients and thus could provide novel leads in the development of therapeutics. ",

Herein we show that the RAS/MAPK pathway regulates the activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12), which is a transcriptional CDK required for genomic stability. We find that melanoma cells harbor constitutively high CDK12 activity, and that its inhibition decreases the expression of long genes containing multiple exons, including many genes involved in DNA repair. Conversely, our results show that CDK12 inhibition promotes the expression of short genes with few exons, including many growth-promoting genes regulated by the AP-1 and NF-&#954;B transcription factors. Inhibition of these pathways strongly synergize with CDK12 inhibitors to suppress melanoma growth, suggesting promising drug combinations for more effective melanoma treatment. ",

To discover host antiviral restriction factors that may act as suitable targets for the development of host-directed antiviral therapies, we here conduct a whole-genome CRISPR activation screen with influenza B virus (IBV). A top hit from our screen, beta-1,3-glucuronyltransferase 1 (B3GAT1), effectively blocks IBV infection. Subsequent studies reveal that B3GAT1 activity prevents cell surface sialic acid expression. Due to this mechanism of action, B3GAT1 expression broadly restricts infection with viruses that require sialic acid for entry, including Victoria and Yamagata lineage IBVs, H1N1/H3N2 influenza A viruses (IAVs), and the unrelated enterovirus D68. To understand the potential utility of B3GAT1 induction as an antiviral strategy in vivo, we specifically express B3GAT1 in the murine respiratory epithelium and find that overexpression is not only well-tolerated, but also protects female mice from a lethal viral challenge with multiple influenza viruses, including a pandemic-like H1N1 IAV.

This is explained by the return to significant levels of international travel following the border's reopening in March 2022. We estimate one Omicron transmission event from the border to the community for every ~5,000 passenger arrivals at the current levels of travel and restriction. Although most of these introductions did not instigate any detected onward transmission, a small minority triggered large outbreaks. Genomic surveillance at the border provides a lens on the rate at which new variants might gain a foothold and trigger new waves of infection. ",

Although &#946;-cell targeted autoimmune processes and &#946;-cell dysfunction are known to occur in type 1 diabetes, a complete understanding of the cell-to-cell interactions that support pancreatic function is still lacking. To characterize the pancreatic endocrine compartment, we studied pancreata from healthy adult donors and investigated a single cell surface adhesion molecule, desmoglein-2 (DSG2). Genetically-modified mice lacking Dsg2 were examined for islet cell mass, insulin production, responses to glucose, susceptibility to a streptozotocin-induced mouse model of hyperglycaemia, and ability to cure diabetes in a syngeneic transplantation model. Herein, we have identified DSG2 as a previously unrecognized adhesion molecule that supports &#946;-cells. Furthermore, we reveal that DSG2 is within the top 10 percent of all genes expressed by human pancreatic islets and is expressed by the insulin-producing &#946;-cells but not the somatostatin-producing &#948;-cells. In a Dsg2 loss-of-function mice (Dsg2lo/lo), we observed a significant reduction in the number of pancreatic islets and islet size, and consequently, there was less total insulin content per islet cluster.

        "AbstractText": "Alpha-terpineol, popular monoterpenoid alcohol, is known to cause cytotoxicity in a few cancer cells or to have antioxidant activity, but underlying mechanisms or apoptotic processes in yeast cell death should be understood. We used the fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) as a unicellular model to monitor cellular toxicology and physiological mechanisms for the involvement of alpha-terpineol in cell death. Alpha-terpineol caused ROS overproduction and following cytotoxicity and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of oxidative stress was proved using sod1 and sod2 mutants (antioxidant-limited cells), and the results showed that apoptosis was caused by alpha-terpineol-driven oxidation. In addition, resorcinol, a herbal extract from medicinal plants, showed protective activity against alpha-terpineol cytotoxicity. Survival rates, apoptotic cell death ratios, oxidation levels, and antioxidant gene expressions were completely altered; surprisingly sod1 and sod2 levels dramatically increased. However, sod2 was highly upregulated in response to resorcinol treatment with alpha-terpineol. The potential role of the Sod2 enzyme was proved using sod2 mutant cells that do not have a mitochondrial radical-clearing activity. Consequently, the dose-dependent and ROS-mediated cytotoxic/apoptotic effects of alpha-terpineol and the Sod2-dependent protective and antioxidant effects of resorcinol were demonstrated in unicellular model organism S. pombe by this study.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of all lung cancer. NSCLC is a highly heterogeneous disease and this affects the prognosis. Therefore, many studies have tried to identify factors that are associated with prognosis. The lungs are a major organ expressing FcRn. We aimed to evaluate FcRn expression in surgical specimens of NSCLC and determine its correlation with patient prognosis. We analyzed 140 NSCLC surgical specimens for FcRn expression using immunohistochemistry and correlated positivity with clinicopathology and survival of these patients. A chi-squared test and Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank tests were performed for statistical evaluation.

We herein illustrate a clinical application of Covid-death mean-imputation (CoDMI) algorithm in LARC patients with Covid-19 infection. We analyzed 94 patients treated for primary LARC. Overall survival was calculated in months from diagnosis to first event (last follow-up/death). Because Covid-19 death events potentially bias survival estimation, to eliminate skewed data due to Covid-19 death events, the observed lifetime of Covid-19 cases was replaced by its corresponding expected lifetime in absence of the Covid-19 event using the CoDMI algorithm. Patients who died of Covid-19 (DoC) are mean-imputed by the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Under this approach, the observed lifetime of each DoC patient is considered as an \"incomplete data\" and is extended by an additional expected lifetime computed using the classical Kaplan-Meier model. Sixteen patients were dead of disease (DoD), 1 patient was DoC and 77 cases were censored (Cen). The DoC patient died of Covid-19 52 months after diagnosis. The CoDMI algorithm computed the expected future lifetime provided by the Kaplan-Meier estimator applied to the no-DoC observations as well as to the DoC data itself. Given the DoC event at 52 months, the CoDMI algorithm estimated that this patient would have died after 79.5 months of follow-up. The CoDMI algorithm leads to \"unbiased\" probability of overall survival in LARC patients with Covid-19 infection, compared to that provided by a na&#239;ve application of Kaplan-Meier approach.

However, the genetic role of the enhancer of EZH2 in the etiology of oral cancer is unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of EZH2 genotypes with oral cancer risk among Taiwanese. Three polymorphic variants of EZH2, rs887569 (C to T), rs41277434 (A to C), and rs3757441 (T to C), were analyzed regarding their association with oral cancer risk among 958 oral cancer patients and the same number of healthy controls by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). In addition, the interaction of EZH2 rs887569, rs41277434, and rs3757441 genotypes with personal behaviors such as smoking, alcohol drinking, and betel quid chewing were also examined. The EZH2 genotypes rs887569, rs41277434, and rs3757441, were not significantly associated with oral cancer risk (p for trend=0.1735, 0.5658, and 0.4606, respectively). The analysis of allelic frequency distribution also supported the findings that the variant alleles at EZH2 rs887569, rs41277434, and rs3757441 may not serve as determinants of oral cancer risk (all p>0.05). There was no interaction between EZH2 rs887569, rs41277434, or rs3757441 genotypes with personal smoking, alcohol drinking or betel quid chewing behaviors.

A 48-year-old woman presented to the referral hospital complaining of prolonged bleeding for the past 6 months. On examination, a mass was identified in the anal canal and the upper part of the rectum that was diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma. Liver, ovarian, and right internal iliac lymph node metastases were found on further examination, and the patient was referred to our department for treatment. Systemic chemotherapy was planned, and six courses of modified FOLFOX6 were administered. After chemotherapy, the liver and right internal iliac lymph node metastases tended to shrink, and no new lesions appeared. Therefore, a total posterior pelvic resection and a bilateral lymph node dissection were performed for the primary tumour and ovarian metastases, and a simultaneous laparoscopic right partial hepatectomy was undertaken for the liver metastases. R0 resection was achieved, and the final diagnosis was T3N3M1a(H) stage IV. The patient remains alive 2 years after the surgery without recurrence. We report a rare case of anal canal cancer with distant metastases who achieved R0 resection after modified FOLFOX6 chemotherapy. ",

These changes may have had an impact on the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, the present study investigated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for CRC using a correlation analysis of clinical outcomes before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study targeted CRC patients who underwent MIS between January 2018 and December 2019 (pre-COVID-19) and between April 2020 and March 2021 (COVID-19). A comparison analysis of clinical, surgical, and pathological findings between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 groups was performed. Ninety-one patients underwent MIS for CRC pre-COVID-19 and 67 during COVID-19. The number of CRC cases detected by fecal occult blood tests was slightly higher in the pre-COVID-19 group than that in the COVID-19 group. Re-evaluations of laparoscopic videos revealed that the number of cases of surgical T4 CRC resected with the combined resection of the adjacent organs was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group than that in the pre-COVID-19 group (16.4 vs. 4.4%, p=0.010). Furthermore, surgical times were significantly longer in the COVID-19 group than those in the pre-COVID-19 group (p<0.001). Pathological findings showed that the number of pT4 cases was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group than that in the pre-COVID-19 group (p=0.026).

This condition is rare and was first described in ectodermal-derived organs, such as the oral cavities and palms, and later in endodermal-derived tissues including the esophagus. SGE of the esophagus is believed to represent a form of acquired metaplasia. SGE is asymptomatic and usually discovered during routine endoscopic examinations for other gastrointestinal complaints and symptoms. It is a benign entity and to date no cases of malignant transformation have been reported. Once diagnosed, SGE requires no further work up or follow up, and does not require treatment. We present two cases of SGE arising in the esophagi of two female patients who presented with complaints of gastro-esophageal reflux and underwent endoscopy. These lesions presented as patchy yellow-white nodules in the mid and upper esophagus and were endoscopically interpreted as suggestive of candidiasis or glycogen acanthosis. Biopsies showed foci of non-keratinizing squamous mucosa overlying the sebaceous glands. These glands exhibited a characteristic lobulated structure with germinative cells at the periphery and vacuolated, well-differentiated cells in the center of the lobules. After histologic examination, the endoscopic impressions of candidiasis and acanthosis were ruled out and the final diagnosis of SGE was made. There was no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy in our cases. Histopathology examination is important to differentiate SGE from malignant and infectious conditions that are more common, and which can be clinically and endoscopically similar to SGE. ",

        "AbstractText": "Primary osteosarcoma of the mammary gland is a very rare disease, accounting for under 1% of all mammary gland malignancies. There is no established first-line treatment, and prognosis is poor compared to conventional breast cancer. We previously demonstrated the efficacy of cisplatinum and eribulin in a patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) mouse model of primary breast osteosarcoma. However, these drugs show significant clinical toxicity. All cancers are addicted to methionine (Hoffman effect). In the present study, we determined whether methionine restriction with oral recombinant methioninase (o-rMETase) would lower the effective dose of cisplatinum in a PDOX model of primary osteosarcoma of the mammary gland, thereby reducing its toxicity. Mouse PDOX models of primary osteosarcoma of the breast were randomized into the following groups: control; cisplatinum (weekly at 3 or 6 mg/kg); twice-daily o-rMETase; or o-rMETase combined with 3 mg/kg cisplatinum, with treatment for 2 weeks. Cisplatinum at 6 mg/kg significantly inhibited breast osteosarcoma growth compared with the untreated control and mice treated with 3 mg/kg cisplatinum (p=0.01 and 0.009, respectively). There was no significant difference in tumor growth between mice treated with cisplatinum at 3 mg/kg and the control (p=0.16). Combination therapy with cisplatinum at 3 mg/kg and twice daily o-rMETase regressed the osteosarcoma of the mammary gland (p=0.009), similar to the inhibition by cisplatinum at 6 mg/kg alone. Cisplatinum at 6 mg/kg caused a significant loss of mouse body weight, compared to the control (p=0.02). There was no significant body-weight loss with the combination therapy of o-rMETase and cisplatinum at 3 mg/kg, compared to the untreated control. o-rMETase halved the effective dose of cisplatinum, thereby eliminating cisplatinum toxicity, demonstrating a future clinical strategy for therapy of osteosarcoma of the breast.

Thirty-five (26.5%) patients showed high PD-L1 SP142 expression on immune cells (ICs). High IC PD-L1 expression was significantly correlated with smaller tumor size (p=0.030), absence of lymphovascular invasion (p=0.024), and fewer lymph node metastases (p=0.002). Multivariate survival analysis revealed that high IC PD-L1 expression independently predicted better disease-free survival (DFS) of TNBC patients. High PD-L1 SP142 expression on ICs was significantly associated with favorable clinicopathological parameters and better outcomes in patients with TNBC. Our observations suggest that high IC PD-L1 expression can be used as an independent prognostic marker for predicting better DFS in patients with TNBC. ",

Its soluble form is induced by secretagogues (e.g., chloroquine), and it induces apoptosis by interacting with the receptor of glucose-regulated protein 78, which is overexpressed in cancer cells. In this study, curcumin was analyzed as an inducer of PAR4 expression in 4T1 murine breast cancer cell. and its ability to induce PAR4 secretion in Balb/c mice. In addition, the cisplatin sensitizing effect of soluble PAR4 was analyzed. The 4T1 cell line was treated in vitro using different concentrations of curcumin; cell viability was analyzed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and PAR4 expression by western blotting. The expression of soluble PAR4 in the serum of mice treated with intraperitoneal curcumin was analyzed using the dot-blot method. Moreover, MTT assay was used to analyze the effects of serum from curcumin-treated mice on cell viability. Tumor size was analyzed in mice treated with curcumin alone and in combination with cisplatin. Curcumin showed a dose- and time-dependent effects on cell viability on 4T1 cells, as well as increasing PAR4 expression. Compared with the control group (phosphate-buffered saline), mice treated with curcumin showed an increase in plasma PAR4. In the Balb/C tumor model, mice treated with curcumin and cisplatin showed greater tumor shrinkage than the control group. These results indicate that curcumin induces expression of soluble PAR4 and sensitizes tumor cells to cisplatin. ",

Yet, traditional Chinese acupuncture is built on concepts which are not in accordance with science-based medicine. Accordingly, our aim was to critically assess the evidence presented in SRs and MAs on xerostomia induced by treatment of head and neck cancer with radiotherapy. In February 2022, a systematic search of five electronic databases (Embase, Cochrane, PsychInfo, CINAHL and Medline) was conducted to find SRs/MAs on acupuncture use against cancer-treatment induced xerostomia. We evaluated all SRs/MAs using the AMSTAR instrument, comparing the assessment of the individual studies included and the conclusions drawn by the authors. In case of heterogeneity between the SRs, we evaluated the controversial items of the assessments directly from the studies. Finally, eight SRs/MAs were included. Most of them show methodological drawbacks in several domains of the AMSTAR instrument, which influences the credibility of the results. The evidence on the use of acupuncture as treatment for radiotherapy-induced xerostomia is low. Present SRs/MAs mainly summarize results of a few and mostly small studies. Even though the included studies greatly overlap, the quality of the presentation and interpretation of the authors differs greatly. Therefore, a high quality and conclusive summary of the present evidence on the use of acupuncture to treat radiotherapy induced xerostomia is still missing. ",

Scientific literature indexed in PubMed and ScienceDirect about Human papillomavirus modulates matrix metalloproteinases was retrieved and critically analyzed, to obtain an overview of expression patterns and their implications for carcinogenesis and patient prognosis. Matrix metalloproteinases such as MMP1, MMP9 and MMP13 have been associated with patient prognosis in HPV-induced cancers and play a major role in the degradation of the extracellular matrix, tumor invasion and metastasis. The HPV E2 and E7 oncoproteins regulate MMP expression via AKT, MEK/ERK and AP-1 signaling among other mechanisms. Increased expression of MMPs is associated with cancer progression and poor prognosis in multiple HPV-induced cancers, suggesting their potential use as prognostic markers. The identification of specific signaling pathways that mediate MMP regulation by HPV is essential for developing efficient new cancer therapies. ",

This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of albumin combined with neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), referring to the albumin-NLR score (ANS), in the prediction of treatment completeness and safety profiles in HNC patients receiving definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). 461 consecutive HNC patients who received CCRT between 2016 and 2017 at three medical centers in Taiwan were prospectively enrolled and divided into three different groups based on their pretreatment ANS (ANS 0, high albumin and low NLR; ANS 1, low albumin or high NLR; and ANS 2, low albumin and high NLR) for treatment completeness and safety profiles comparison. Overall, 46 patients (10.0%) had incomplete CCRT treatment. Patients in the ANS 2 group experienced a higher rate of incomplete CCRT (20.9%) than those in the ANS 1 (7.4%) and ANS 0 (3.5%) groups. ANS had a better discriminatory ability in predicting CCRT completeness in terms of -2 log-likelihood value, chi-square value, and c-index than the prognostic nutritional index. Patients in the ANS 2 group had significantly higher incidences of grade 3 or higher leukopenia, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, non-neutropenic infection, and hypokalemia than those in the other two ANS groups.

In lipomas and pleomorphic adenomas, the translocation fuses HMGA2 (12q14) with the NFIB gene from 9p22; in myolipoma, it fuses HMGA2 with C9orf92 from 9p22; and in chondroid hamartomas, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) investigations showed the chromosomal aberration to cause intragenic rearrangement of HMGA2. The translocation's molecular consequence in a uterine leiomyoma is described here. A typical leiomyoma was investigated using banding cytogenetics, FISH, RNA sequencing, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing. A single translocation, t(9;12)(p22;q14) leading to an HMGA2::BNC2 chimera, was found in tumor cells. A sequence of the untranslated part of exon 5 of HMGA2 (nucleotide 1035 in the NCBI reference sequence NM_003483.4) had fused with a sequence from the untranslated part of exon 7 of BNC2 from 9p22 (nucleotide 9284 in reference sequence NM_017637.6). At the molecular level, the t(9;12)(p22;q14~15) found in several benign tumors appears to be heterogeneous fusing HMGA2 with either BNC2, C9orf92 or NFIB which all three map close to one another within a 3 Mbp region in 9p22. Because the fusion point in HMGA2 in the present tumor lays downstream from the first Let-7 miRNA consensus binding site, we conclude that deletion of the first Let-7 miRNA binding site is not important for the transcriptional upregulation of HMGA2 caused by the genomic rearrangement.

P311 plays an essential role in promoting wound closure by enhancing the biological function of epidermal stem cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. Nevertheless, whether and how P311 regulates macrophage polarization remains unclear. Herein we demonstrated that P311 deficiency reduced the M2 polarization of macrophages, thereby it attenuated the secretion of M2-like cytokines. The P311 deficiency prolonged the transition from the pro-inflammatory phase to the pro-healing phase, accompanied by weakened angiogenesis and retarded granulation tissue formation, both of which coordinately hinder the healing of skin wounds. Mechanistically, P311 deficiency down-regulated the expression of IL-4R on macrophages followed by a less activation of the IL-4R-STAT6 signaling pathway, resulting in impaired M2 macrophage polarization. We further revealed that the mTOR signaling pathway was associated with the regulation of P311 on the expression of IL-4R in macrophages. Thus, our study has highlighted the pivotal role of P311 in promoting the M2 polarization of macrophages for effective skin wound healing. ",

There is strong evidence suggesting that individual tumor foci can arise as genetically distinct, clonally independent lesions.

The clonal relationship of adjacent GP3 and GP5 lesions has thus far not been investigated. Here we analyzed a cohort of 14 cases-11 biopsy and 3 radical prostatectomy specimens-with a Gleason score of 3+5=8 or 5+3=8 present in the same biopsy or in a single dominant tumor nodule at radical prostatectomy. Clonal and subclonal relationships between GP3 and GP5 lesions were assessed using genetically validated immunohistochemical assays for ERG, PTEN, and P53. 9/14 (64%) cases showed ERG reactivity in both GP3 and GP5 lesions. Only 1/14 (7%) cases showed a discordant pattern with ERG staining present only in GP3. PTEN expression was lost in 2/14 (14%) cases with perfect concordance between GP5 and GP3.

Recently, suicide gene therapy with the Herpex Simplex Virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) gene has been developed with high therapeutic potency, even in clinical trials. The primary challenge to establishing a gene therapy strategy is how to transfer the desired gene into the tumor site. The olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) secreting neurotropic and anti-inflammatory factors have a high migration capacity, making them applicable for gene therapy. We examined our new construct OECs containing the HSV-tk gene for their migration and tumoricidal ability in animal models of GBM. Isolated OECs were transduced by the HSV-tk gene (OEC-tks). OEC-tks or PBS were injected ipsilaterally or contralaterally into the tumor-bearing rats, followed by gancyclovir (GCV) or PBS administration. At the end of the treatment, tumor size, apoptosis, and animal survival were assessed. Our findings demonstrated that tumor size was significantly decreased in OEC-tks ipsilateral and contralateral groups, followed by GCV injections. Furthermore, both groups' pro-apoptotic protein and gene expressions were up-regulated, whereas Bcl-2 protein expression was down-regulated. Besides, apoptosis in the OEC-tks ipsilateral/GCV group was higher in the intratumoral region, and this percentage was higher in the OEC-tks contralateral/GCV group in the peritumoral region. Interestingly, our new construct increased animal survival rate and reduced body weight loss. OECs could serve as a novel carrier for gene therapy, have a high migration capability to the GBM and eventually suppress tumor progression. ",

During this period, it has gone through numerous disappointments when the successes obtained in the laboratory were not matched clinically. However, recent advances in immuno-oncology have provided the impetus to revisit this therapeutic option. Unlike previous efforts, modern immunotherapy is now a realistic and formidable therapeutic option for patients with relapsed/refractory malignancies. Unfortunately, most of the successes obtained thus far have primarily been in patients with hematologic malignancies. While the results of immunotherapy with immune check-point inhibitors for solid tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma are encouraging, more effective treatment methods are desirable. Many intrinsic and extrinsic factors pose as obstacles to successful immunotherapy of solid tumors. They include heterogeneity of tumor antigens, limitation in the trafficking and accessibility of the effector mechanisms to the tumor sites, the adverse anti-inflammatory tumor microenvironment, and the on-target off tumor and off-target off-tumor effects of some of these approaches. In this review, we will discuss these obstacles and examine the evidence that support the notion that radioimmunotherapy, using radioimmunoconjugates, may be the answer to overcome these obstacles in patients with metastatic cancer. Finally, we will discuss how the efficacy of radioimmunotherapy using radioimmunoconjugates might further be harnessed to maximize successes in these patients. ",

        "AbstractText": "DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors are used for treatment of certain hematological malignancies and exert anti-cancer activity through diverse mechanisms, including reexpression of tumor suppressor genes and anti-viral responses triggered by expression of endogenous retroviruses. Despite advances in the pharmacokinetic properties of DNMT inhibitors, the efficacy of these drugs in solid cancers remains low. Here, we show in cell lines and clinical and experimental tumors across multiple cancer types that DNMT inhibition induces the expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1), a cytokine with proinflammatory and protumorigenic properties. Specifically, this tumor-intrinsic IL-1 expression modulates the chemokine landscape of tumors and leads to the recruitment of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells to the tumor microenvironment, processes that can be blocked by IL-1 antagonists. Molecular analysis demonstrates complex patterns of IL-1 and interferon activation and crosstalk in response to DNMT inhibition, which depend on the integrity of IRF- and NF-&#954;B-mediated antiviral pathways and may determine the outcome of DNMT-inhibitor treatment. Together, our results show that DNMT inhibitors may negatively affect the microenvironment of a large subset of tumors and suggest that co-treatment with IL-1 antagonists may be a favorable combination for these patients.

        "AbstractText": "Accumulating evidence not only supports the functional role of the gut microbiome in cancer development and progression but also its role in defining the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents (5-fluorouracil, CTX, Irinotecan, Oxaliplatin, Gemcitabine, Methotrexate) and immunotherapeutic (anti-PD-L1/ anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4) compounds. This evidence is supported in numerous in-vitro, animal and clinical studies which highlight the importance of microbial mechanisms in defining therapeutic responses. The microbiome therefore shapes oncological outcomes, and it is now being leveraged for the development of novel personalised therapeutic approaches in cancer treatment. However, if the microbiome is to be successfully translated into next generation oncological treatments, a new multimodal model of the oncomicrobiome must be conceptualized which incorporates gut microbial co-metabolism of pharmacological agents into cancer care. The objective of this review is therefore to outline the current knowledge on oncological pharmacomicrobiomics and to describe how the multiparametric functions of the gut microbiome influence treatment response across cancer types. The secondary objective is to propose innovative approaches for modulating the gut microbiome in clinical environments which improve therapy efficacy and diminish toxic effects derived from anti-neoplastic agents for patient benefit.

As the expression and role of PEDF in BC bone metastases is unknown, we aimed to characterise PEDF in primary and metastatic BC. Subcellular PEDF localisation was semi-quantitatively analysed via immunohistochemistry in patient-matched, archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary BC and liver, lung, and decalcified bone metastases specimens. PEDF localisation was evaluated in 23 metastatic BC patients diagnosed with ER+, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) negative BC or TNBC. Cytoplasmic (p&#8239;=&#8239;0.019) and membrane (p&#8239;=&#8239;0.048) PEDF was lower in bone metastases compared to primary ER+/HER2- BC. In contrast, nuclear PEDF scores were higher in metastases compared to primary TNBC (p&#8239;=&#8239;0.027), and increased membrane PEDF in metastatic tissue had improved disease-free interval (p&#8239;=&#8239;0.016). Nuclear PEDF was decreased in bone metastases compared to primary ER+//HER2- BC in post-menopausal patients (p&#8239;=&#8239;0.029). These novel findings indicate PEDF plays a role in clinical BC metastasis. Significantly lower PEDF levels in the post-menopausal compared to pre-menopausal setting suggests future PEDF research may have greater clinical importance in the post-menopausal ER+/HER2- BC population.

        "AbstractText": "Gastrointestinal cancer stem cell marker doublecortin-like kinase (DCLK1) is strongly associated with poor outcomes in colorectal cancer (CRC). While DCLK1's regulatory effect on the tumor immune microenvironment has been hypothesized, its mode of action has not previously been demonstrated in vivo, which hampers the potential intervention based on this molecule for clinical practice. To define the immunomodulatory mechanisms of DCLK1 in vivo, we generated the DCLK1-/- tumor cells by CRIPSR-Cas9 and developed subcutaneous and intestinal orthotopic transplantation tumor models. Tumor tissues were harvested and subjected to immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry analysis of tumor infiltrating immune cell populations, tumor myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) sorting by isolation kit and then co-culture with spleen T cells, and RNA-sequencing for transcriptomic analysis. We found DCLK1-/- tumor cells lose their tumorigenicity under immune surveillance. Failed tumor establishment of DCLK1-/- was associated with an increase in infiltration of CD8+ T cells and effector CD4+ T cells, and reduced numbers of MDSCs in the tumor tissue. Furthermore, DCLK1 promoted the upregulation of CXCL1, which recruits MDSCs in CRC through CXCR2. The ability of in vivo tumor growth of DCLK1-/- tumor cells was rescued by CXCL1 overexpression. Collectively, we validated that DCLK1 promotes tumor growth in CRC through recruitment of T cell suppressive MDSCs. DCLK1-mediated immune suppression in tumor models allows escape from the host's antitumor response. As DCLK1 is one of the most common markers in gastrointestinal tumors, these results identify a precise therapeutic target for related clinical interventions. ",

Moreover, the risk of potential tumor upstaging is unknown; therefore, the application of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is required for analysis. We systematically reviewed the real-world data to evaluate the optimal treatment and potential predictors of poorer prognosis for MPD. The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant studies. Clinical studies were included if they evaluated the outcome of positive rates of SLNB, prognostic risk factors of MPD, and survival outcomes of treatments of interest for MPD, including mastectomy, breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with radiotherapy, and BCS alone. A total of 38 studies with 24,062 patients were retrieved. Compared with BCS alone (21.2%), mastectomy (5.9%; P&#8239;<&#8239;0.001) and BCS with radiotherapy (8; P&#8239;=&#8239;0.001) had significantly lower local recurrence rates.

The positive rate of SLNB was 17% (95% CI: 0.115-0.226). Except for MPD alone, BCS alone is not recommended for treating MPD with invasive ductal carcinoma and MPD with ductal carcinoma in situ. Moreover, a palpable mass, underlying invasive carcinoma, and positive lymph node status may lead to a poorer prognosis, which may be taken into consideration for the application of SLNB. ",

Quartz crystal dissipation and isothermal titration calorimetry have been used to investigate such chiral-specific interactions. d-SPs are more thermodynamically stable compared with l-SPs in terms of their adhesion. Proteases and other endogenous proteins can be shielded by the opposite chirality of d-SPs, resulting in longer half-lives. Incorporating nanosystems with d-chirality increases uptake by cancer cells and prolongs in vivo stability, demonstrating the importance of chirality in biomaterials. Thus, as we discuss here, chiral nanosystems could enhance drug delivery systems, tumor markers, and biosensors, among other biomaterial-based technologies, by allowing for better control over their features.

We aimed to determine the relevance of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the development of NASH induced by CCl4 along with an hepatopathogenic diet in male Wistar rats. Animals were fed either a high fat, sucrose, and cholesterol diet (HFSCD) or a HFSCD plus intraperitoneal injections of low doses of CCl4 (400 mg/kg) once a week for 15 weeks. Liver steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation were evaluated using biochemical, histological, ultrastructural, and immunofluorescence analyses, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Our experimental model reproduced several aspects of the human NASH pathophysiology. NLRP3 inflammasome activation was induced by the combined effect of HFSCD plus CCl4 and significantly increased levels of both proinflammatory and profibrogenic cytokines and collagen deposition in the liver; thus, NASH severity was higher in the HFSCD+CCl4 group than that in the HFSCD group, to which CCl4 was not administered. Hepatic stellate cells, the most profibrogenic cells, were activated by HFSCD plus CCl4, as indicated by elevated levels of &#945;-smooth muscle actin. Thus, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, triggered by low doses of CCl4, exacerbates the severity of NASH. Our results indicate that NLRP3 inflammasome activation plays a key role and may be an important therapeutic target for NASH treatment. ",

Therefore, targeting PD-L1 is considered to be an attractive approach for cancer immunotherapy. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that &#969;-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) reduced the expression of PD-L1 in cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Promotion of PD-L1 ubiquitin-proteasome degradation by DHA resulted in a decrease of PD-L1 expression, leading to reduction of PD-L1 and PD-1 interaction, and reversing PD-L1-mediated immune suppression, which in turn contributed to the inhibitory effect on tumor growth. Furtherly, DHA significantly reduced fatty acid synthase (FASN) expression in cancer cells, which inhibited the palmitoyltransferases DHHC5, promoting the CSN5-dependent PD-L1 degradation. Our present finding uncovered a novel mechanism involved in the anti-cancer activity of DHA, and implicated that DHA holds promising potential to be developed as a novel immune-enhancer for cancer treatment and prevention.

Twenty-five patients were included in this study. Each patient was positioned using skin marks and tattoos (procedure A) for half of the fractions and surface guidance using AlignRT (procedure B) for the other half of the fractions. The order of the two procedures was randomized. Pretreatment CBCT was acquired at every fraction for both setup procedures. A total of ten time points were recorded during every treatment session. Applied couch shifts after CBCT match were recorded and used for potential error calculations if no CBCT had been used. In the vertical direction procedure B showed significant smaller population based systematic (&#425;) and random (&#963;) errors. However, a significant larger systematic error on the individual patient level (M) was also shown. This was found to be due to patient relaxation between setup and CBCT matching. Procedure B also showed a significant smaller random error in the lateral direction, while no significant differences were seen in the longitudinal direction. No significant difference in setup time was found between the two procedures. Setup of right sided breast cancer patients using surface guidance yields higher accuracy than setup using skin marks/tattoos and lasers with the same setup time. Patient alignment for this patient group can safely be done without the use of permanent tattoos and skin marks when utilizing surface-guided patient positioning.

        "AbstractText": "Steroid receptors (SRs) are ligand-dependent transcription factors (TFs) relevant to key cellular processes in both physiology and pathology, including some types of cancer. SOX2 is a master TF of pluripotency and self-renewal of embryonic stem cells, and its dysregulation is also associated with various types of human cancers. A potential crosstalk between these TFs could be relevant in malignant cells yet, to the best of our knowledge, no formal study has been performed thus far. Here we show, by quantitative live-cell imaging microscopy, that ectopic expression of SOX2 disrupts the formation of hormone-dependent intranuclear condensates of many steroid receptors (SRs), including those formed by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). SOX2 also reduces GR's binding to specific DNA targets and modulates its transcriptional activity. SOX2-driven effects on GR condensates do not require the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain of the receptor and, surprisingly, neither relies on GR/SOX2 interactions. SOX2 also alters the intranuclear dynamics and compartmentalization of the SR coactivator NCoA-2 and impairs GR/NCoA-2 interactions. These results suggest an indirect mechanism underlying SOX2-driven effects on SRs involving this coactivator. Together, these results highlight that the transcriptional program elicited by GR relies on its nuclear organization and is intimately linked to the distribution of other GR partners, such as the NCoA-2 coactivator. Abnormal expression of SOX2, commonly observed in many tumors, may alter the biological action of GR and, probably, other SRs as well. Understanding this crosstalk may help to improve steroid hormone-based therapies in cancers with elevated SOX2 expression. ",

        "AbstractText": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Despite new treatment approvals, treatment response and prognosis of patients with advanced HCC remain poor. Claudin-1 (CLDN1) is a membrane protein expressed not only at tight junctions but also non-junctionally such as the basolateral membrane of the human hepatocyte. While CLDN1 within tight junctions is well characterized, the role of non-junctional CLDN1 and its role as a therapeutic target in HCC remains unexplored. Using humanized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting specifically the extracellular loop of human non-junctional CLDN1 and a large series of patient-derived cell-based and animal model systems we aimed to investigate the role of CLDN1 as a therapeutic target for HCC. Targeting non-junctional CLDN1 markedly suppressed tumor growth and invasion in cell line-based models of HCC and patient-derived 3D ex vivo models. Moreover, the robust effect on tumor growth was confirmed in vivo in a large series of cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models. Mechanistic studies including single-cell RNA sequencing of multicellular patient HCC tumorspheres suggested that CLDN1 regulates tumor stemness, metabolism, oncogenic signaling and perturbs the tumor immune microenvironment. Our results provide the rationale for targeting CLDN1 in HCC and pave the way to novel therapeutic interventions with CLDN1 mAbs aimed at improving the limited efficacy of current therapies. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a cancer with high mortality and unsatisfactory treatment options. Here we identified the cell surface protein Claudin-1 as a target for treatment of advanced HCC. Monoclonal antibodies targeting Claudin-1 inhibit tumor growth in patient-derived ex vivo and in vivo models by modulating signaling, cell stemness and the tumor immune microenvironment. Given the differentiated mechanism of action, the identification of Claudin-1 as a novel therapeutic target for HCC provides an opportunity to break the plateau of limited treatment response. These results of this preclinical study pave the way for the clinical development of Claudin-1 specific antibodies for treatment of HCC in patients. It is therefore of key impact for physicians, scientists and drug developers in the field of liver cancer and GI oncology. ",

Beyond KIT and other genes recurrently mutated in myeloid neoplasms, several genetic variants have been described as predisposing to the development of the disease and influencing its clinical phenotype. Increased copy number variants of the TPSAB1 gene were identified as a cause of non-clonal elevated tryptasemia and defined as Hereditary alpha-tryptasemia (H&#945;T). Moreover, it was recently found that H&#945;T is enriched in patients with SM, where it can affect the incidence of mediator-related symptoms. In a multi-center dataset of 444 patients with mast cell disorders, we aimed to investigate the clinical correlates of germline TPSAB1 copy number gains. Droplet digital PCR was performed in all cases to ascertain the presence of H&#945;T. Clinical history, along with blood values and bone marrow examination were analyzed. We confirmed a higher incidence of H&#945;T+ cases (n=59, 13.3%) in patients diagnosed with mastocytosis with respect to the general population (around 5%). H&#945;T+ patients were characterized by a lower mast cell-associated disease burden and higher levels of tryptase. Several disease variables were coherent with this pattern, from bone marrow MC infiltration to MC-related histopathological traits, that also accounted for a significantly higher incidence of clonal MC activation syndrome in H&#945;T+ (10.2%) compared to H&#945;T- (3.4%, P=0.029) patients. We also confirmed that H&#945;T+ carriers had a significantly higher frequency of anaphylaxis, without relevant differences for other clinical manifestations.

Whereas numerous p53 target genes have been identified, only a few appear to be critical for the suppression of tumor growth. Additionally, while ferroptosis is clearly implicated in tumor suppression by p53, few p53 target genes with roles in ferroptosis have been identified. We have previously studied germline missense p53 variants that are hypomorphic, or display reduced activity. These hypomorphic variants are associated with increased risk for cancer, but they retain the majority of p53 transcriptional function; as such, study of the transcriptional targets of these hypomorphs has the potential to reveal the identity of other genes important for p53-mediated tumor suppression. Here, using RNA sequencing in lymphoblastoid cell lines, we identify PLTP (phospholipid transfer protein) as a p53 target gene that shows impaired transactivation by three different cancer-associated p53 hypomorphs: P47S (Pro47Ser, rs1800371), Y107H (Tyr107His, rs368771578), and G334R (Gly334Arg, rs78378222).

In co-culture experiments, B cells from old mice showed a strong helper function on T cells from young mice, making them pro-inflammatory, and this effect is regulated by metabolic pathways, mainly anaerobic glycolysis, leading to increased RNA expression of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) and increased secretion of lactate.

When we measured the effects of lactate on isolated CD4+ T cells from young mice, we found that lactate increases RNA expression of LDHA, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and NF-kB activation. Moreover, lactate effects in culture can be abrogated in the presence of the specific inhibitor of LDHA, FX11. These results altogether may have relevant clinical implications and suggest novel targets for therapeutic interventions in patients with inflammatory conditions and diseases. ",

        "ArticleTitle": "A PARP1 PROTAC as a novel strategy against PARP inhibitor resistance via promotion of ferroptosis in p53-positive breast cancer. ",
        "AbstractText": "Therapeutic targeting of the nuclear enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) with PARP inhibitors (PARPis) in patients with a homologous recombination (HR)- deficient phenotype based on the mechanism of synthetic lethality has been shown tremendous success in cancer therapy. With the clinical use of various PARPis, emerging evidence has shown that some PARPis offer hope for breakthroughs in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) therapy, regardless of HR status. However, similar to other conventional cytotoxic drugs, PARPis are also subject to the intractable problem of drug resistance. Notably, acquired resistance to PARPis caused by point mutations in the PARP1 protein is hard to overcome with current strategies. To explore modalities to overcome resistance and identify patients who are most likely to benefit from PARP1-targeted therapy, we developed a proteolysis-targeted chimaera (PROTAC) to degrade mutant PARP1 in TNBC. Here, we investigated a PARP1 PROTAC termed \"NN3\", which triggered ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of PARP1. Moreover, NN3 degraded PARP1 with resistance-related mutations. Interestingly, compared with other reported PARP1 degraders, NN3 exhibited a unique antitumor mechanism in p53-positive breast cancer cells that effectively promoted ferroptosis by downregulating the SLC7A11 pathway. Furthermore, NN3 showed potent activity and low toxicity in vivo. In conclusion, we propose PROTAC-mediated degradation of PARP1 as a novel strategy against mutation-related PARPi resistance and a paradigm for targeting breast cancer with functional p53 via ferroptosis induction.

        "AbstractText": "Globally, breast cancer is the most frequent type of cancer in women, and most breast cancer-associated deaths are due to metastasis and recurrence of the disease. Dietary habits, specifically dietary fat intake is a crucial risk factor involved in breast cancer development and progression. Decades of research has revealed that free-fatty acids (FFA) modulate carcinogenic processes through fatty acid metabolism and lipid peroxidation. The ground-breaking discovery of free-fatty acid receptors, which are members of the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) superfamily, has led to the realization FFA can also act via these receptors to modulate carcinogenic effects. The long-chain free-fatty acid receptors FFA1 (previously termed GPR40) and FFA4 (previously termed GPR120) are activated by mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids including &#969;-3, 6, and 9 fatty acids. Initial enthusiasm towards the study of these receptors focused on their insulin secretagogue and sensitization effects, and the downstream associated metabolic regulation. However, recent studies have demonstrated that abnormal expression and/or aberrant FFA1/FFA4 signaling are evident in human breast carcinomas, suggesting that FFA receptors could be a promising target in the treatment of breast cancer. The current review discusses the diverse roles of FFA1 and FFA4 in the regulation of cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and chemotherapy resistance in human breast carcinoma cells and tissue.

Proton therapy (PT) was delivered to at risk nodal regions, excluding the primary mucosal site. Secondary to insurance denial for PT, IMRT was allowed. EORTC-HN35 and PROMIS10 surveys (QOL) and modified barium swallowing impairment profiles (MBSImP) were obtained at baseline prior to RT, then 3 months and 12 months post RT. Kaplan-Meier estimates were calculated for time-to-event clinical outcomes and repeated measures mixed models were utilized for explore changes in QOL over time. Comparison of QOL and swallowing outcomes with standard of care treatment was analyzed. There were 61 evaluable pts with a median follow up of 38 months (range, 10 - 64), 44 (72%) were treated with PT and 17 (28%) were treated with IMRT. The 2-year LC, LRC, DMFS, and OS were 98%, 97%, 98% and 100%, respectively. There were 6 grade &#8805;3 events related to treatment. Two IMRT patients required PEG tube placement during treatment secondary to significant nausea due to dysgeusia. Patients noted significant QOL improvement over time in the pain, swallowing, speech, social eating, social contact, mouth opening, and use of pain medication domains (all p < 0.02). MBSImP overall severity score as well as oral and pharyngeal impairment scores showed stability with no significant change over time. For the 44 patients treated with PT, the mean D95 to the primary target was 10.7 Gy (SD&#8239;=&#8239;12.5 Gy).

We report local control and toxicity outcomes after dose-escalated two-fraction spine SBRT. A prospectively maintained institutional database of over 600 patients and 1400 vertebral segments treated with spine SBRT was reviewed to identify those prescribed 28 Gy or 24 Gy in two daily fractions. The primary endpoint was MRI-based local failure (LF), and secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and vertebral compression fracture (VCF). A total of&#160;947 treated vertebral segments in 482 patients were identified, of which 301 segments in 159 patients received 28 Gy, and 646 segments in 323 patients received 24 Gy, in 2 fractions. Median follow-up per patient was 23.5 months and median OS was 49.1 months. In the 28 Gy cohort, the 6-, 12-, and 24-month cumulative incidences of LF were 3.5%, 5.4% and 11.1%, respectively, vs. 6.0%, 12.5% and 17.6% in the 24 Gy cohort, respectively (p=0.008). On multivariable analysis, 24 Gy (HR:1.525, 95%CI: 1.039-2.238, p=0.031), paraspinal disease extension (HR:1.422, 95%CI: 1.010-2.002, p=0.044), and epidural extension in either radioresistant or radiosensitive histologies (HR 2.117 and 1.227, respectively, p=0.003) were prognostic for higher rates of LF.

        "AbstractText": "We developed a deep learning (DL) model for fast deformable image registration using 2D sagittal cine MRI acquired during radiation therapy and evaluated its potential for real-time target tracking compared to conventional image registration methods. Our DL model uses a pair of cine MRI images as input and provides a motion vector field (MVF) as output. The MVF is then applied to align the input images. A retrospective study was conducted to train and evaluate our model using cine MRI data from patients undergoing treatment for abdominal and thoracic tumors. For each treatment fraction, MR-LINAC delivery log files, tracking videos, and cine DICOM files were analyzed. Individual MRI frames were temporally sampled to construct a large set of image registration pairs used to evaluate multiple methods. The DL model was optimized using five-fold cross validation, and model outputs (transformed images and MVFs) using test set images were saved for comparison with three conventional registration methods (affine, b-spline, and demons). Evaluation metrics were three-fold: 1) registration error, 2) MVF stability (both spatial and temporal), and 3) average computation time. We analyzed >21 hours of cine MRI (>629,000 frames) acquired during 86 treatment fractions from 21 patients. In a test set of 10,320 image registration pairs, DL registration outperformed conventional methods in both registration error (affine, b-spline, demons, DL; RMSE: 0.067, 0.040, 0.036, 0.032; paired t-test demons vs DL: t(20)=4.2, p<0.001) and computation time per frame (51 ms, 1150 ms, 4583 ms, 8 ms). Among deformable methods, spatial stability of resulting MVFs was comparable; however, the DL model had significantly improved temporal consistency. DL-based image registration can leverage large-scale MR cine datasets to outperform conventional registration methods and is a promising solution for real-time deformable motion estimation in radiation therapy. Fast and accurate image registration is fundamental to achieving real-time target tracking and effective beam-gating with MR-LINACs. The increasing clinical adoption of MR-LINACs is generating massive clinical cine MRI datasets, which can be leveraged to enable self-supervised learning algorithms for fast deformable registration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the performance of deep convolutional neural networks and self-supervised learning for 2D cine MRI registration using clinical data from the ViewRay MR-LINAC system.

        "AbstractText": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, many radiation oncology departments worldwide adopted the use of shorter and more intense hypofractionated regimens. Hospital foot traffic was reduced through virtual care. This study's primary objective was to assess the collective environmental impact of these strategic changes by identifying sources of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e). The rate of radiation-related adverse event from the increased use of hypofractionated treatments was assessed. All patients treated with external beam radiation therapy from April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2021 at our single institution were identified (n=10,175) along with their radiotherapy visits (176,423 fractions), and unplanned visits to the radiation nursing clinic (RNC) or emergency (ER) department. Out-patient hospital and virtual visits (n=75,853) during this same period were also analyzed. Environmental impact measures, including linear accelerator power usage, patient travel distances, and personal protection equipment (PPE) consumption were all converted into CO2e. The use of curative hypofractionated regimens increased from 17% to 27% during the pandemic year. Carbon footprint was reduced by 39% during the pandemic year (1,332,388 kg CO2e) as compared to the pre-pandemic year (2,024,823 kg CO2e). Comparing patients in the pre-pandemic vs. pandemic year, there was a significant reduction in the proportion of hypofractionated patients who needed a visit to either the RNC (39% vs. 25%; p<0.001) or ER (6% vs. 2%; p<0.001) during and within 90 days of radiotherapy. This is the first study to demonstrate the environmental benefits of increased use of hypofractionated regimens and virtual care, while assuring that there was no added acute radiation-related adverse event. Our findings support their continued use as one of many long-term strategies to reduce the environmental footprint of healthcare delivery. ",

We evaluated commercial prices paid by private insurers for 4 common RT procedures-Intensity modulated RT (IMRT) planning, IMRT delivery, 3DRT planning, and 3DRT delivery-reported among the 2,096 U.S. hospitals that deliver RT according to the Medicare Provider of Service (POS) file. To assess price variation within hospitals, we evaluated the ratio of the 90th percentile price to the 10th percentile price among different private insurers. To assess regional variation, we similarly compared median commercial prices at the 90th and 10th percentile hospitals in each Hospital Referral Region (HRR). We generated multivariable models to test the association of various hospital, health system, regional, and market factors on median hospital commercial prices. A total of 1,004 hospitals (47.9%) reported at least one commercial price for any of the 4 RT procedures considered in this study. National median commercial prices for IMRT planning and IMRT delivery were $4,073 (IQR: $2,242-$6,305) and $1,666 (IQR: $1,014-$2,619), respectively. Prices for 3D-RT planning and 3D-RT delivery were $2,824 (IQR: $1,339-$4,738) and $616 (IQR: $419-877), respectively. Within hospitals, the 90th percentile price paid by a private insurer was 2.3 to 2.5 times higher on average than the 10th percentile price, depending on the procedure. Within each HRR, the median price at the 90th percentile hospital was between 2.4 and 3.2 times higher than at the 10th percentile hospital. On multivariable analysis, higher prices were generally observed at hospitals with for-profit ownership, teaching status, and affiliation with large health systems. Levels of radiation oncology practice consolidation were not significantly associated with any prices. Commercial prices for common RT procedures vary by more than a factor of 2 depending on a patient's private insurer and hospital of choice.

Underwater endoscopic mucosal resection (UEMR) has emerged as an alternative method. There are few comparative studies between these techniques, especially evaluating recurrence. Then, the purpose of this trial was to compare CEMR and UEMR for the resection of colorectal lesions with respect to efficacy, safety and recurrence rate. Randomized controlled trial of UEMR versus CEMR for na&#239;ve and non-pedunculated lesions measuring between 10 and 40 mm. The primary outcome was adenoma recurrence at 6 months after the resection. Secondary outcomes were technical success, en bloc resection and adverse events rates. Block randomization was used to assign patients. Tattooing was performed to facilitate localization of the scars and eventual recurrences. Endoscopic follow-up was scheduled at 6 months after the procedure. The sites of resections were examined with white light, Narrow-Band Imaging and conventional chromoscopy with indigo carmine followed by biopsies. One hundred and five patients with 120 lesions were included, with a mean size of 17.5 &#177; 7.1 (SD) mm. Sixty-one lesions were resected underwater and 59 by CEMR. The groups were similar at baseline, regarding age, gender, average size, or histological type. Lesions in the proximal colon in the conventional group corresponded to 83% and in the UEMR group to 67.8% (p=0.073). There was no difference between groups regarding success rate (one failure in each group) and en bloc resection rate (60.6% UEMR vs 54.2% CEMR, p = 0.48). Intra-procedure bleeding was observed in five conventional resections (8.5%) and two UEMRs (3.3%) (p = 0.27). There was no perforation or delayed hemorrhage in both groups. Recurrence rate was higher in the CEMR arm (15%) than in UEMR (2%) (p=0.031). Therefore, the relative risk of 6-month recurrence rate in the CEMR group was 7.5 fold higher (95% CI - 0.98 to 58.20) with a NNT of 7.7 (95% CI - 40.33 to 4.22). The higher recurrence rate in CEMR group persisted only for lesions measuring 21-40mm (35.7 vs. 0%, p=0.04). This study demonstrated that UEMR was associated with lower adenoma recurrence rate than CEMR. Both endoscopic techniques are effective and have similar rates of adverse events for the treatment of non-pedunculated colorectal lesions. ",

Its beneficial impact on other infections, by nontuberculous mycobacteria, and by viruses, has been more often studied in recent years, especially after the introduction of the concept of trained immunity. The present study's objective was to review the possible indications of BCG and the immunological rationale for these indications.

There is epidemiological evidence that BCG can reduce overall child morbidity/mortality beyond what would be expected from TB control. BCG is able to promote cross-immunity with nontuberculous mycobacteria and other bacteria. BCG promotes in vitro changes that increase innate immune response to other infections, mainly viral ones, through mechanisms known as trained immunity. Effects on cancer, except bladder cancer, and on autoimmune and allergic diseases are debatable. Despite evidence obtained from in vitro studies, and some epidemiological and clinical evidence, more robust evidence of in vivo efficacy is still needed to justify the use of BCG in clinical practice, in addition to what is recommended by the National Immunization Program for TB prevention and bladder cancer treatment.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched seven databases (CINAHL Plus, Cochrane Library, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science) and two clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) published (or registered) from database inception to Jan 30, 2022, with no language restrictions. We included studies that compared the effects of physical activity or exercise interventions with controls (no intervention or usual care) on cognitive function among individuals diagnosed with any type of cancer at age 0-19 years. Two reviewers (JDKB and FR) independently screened records for eligibility and searched references of the selected studies; extracted study-level data from published reports; and assessed study risk of bias of RCTs and NRSIs using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2) and Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tools, certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach, and any adverse events. We used intention-to-treat data and unpublished data if available. Cognitive function was assessed by standardised cognitive performance measures (primary outcome) and by validated patient-reported measures (secondary outcome). A random-effects meta-analysis model using the inverse-variance and Hartung-Knapp methods was used to calculate pooled estimates (Hedges' g) and 95% CI values. We estimated the heterogeneity variance by the restricted maximum likelihood method and calculated I2 values to measure heterogeneity. We examined funnel plots and used Egger's regression test to assess for publication bias. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021261061. We screened 12&#8201;425 titles and abstracts, which resulted in full-text assessment of 131 potentially relevant reports. We evaluated 22 unique studies (16 RCTs and six NRSIs) with data on 1277 individuals affected by childhood cancer and low-to-moderate risk of bias. Of the 1277 individuals, 674 [52&#183;8%] were male and 603 [47&#183;2%] were female; median age at study start was 12 (IQR 11-14) years, median time since the end of cancer treatment was 2&#183;5 (IQR -1&#183;1 to 3&#183;0) years, and median intervention period was 12 [IQR 10-24] weeks.

Catalyst-free solar light/periodate (PI) system has recently presented great potential in water disinfection, whereas the in-depth chemical and microbiological mechanisms for efficient bacterial inactivation remain unclear. Our work delineated firstly the critical role of singlet oxygen, instead of reported hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radicals, in dominating bacterial inactivation by the PI/simulated sunlight (SSL) system. Multi-evidence demonstrated the prominent disinfection performance of this system for Staphylococcus aureus in terms of culturability (> 6 logs CFU), cellular integrity, and metabolic activity. Particularly, the excellent intracellular DNA removal (> 95%) indicated that PI/SSL system may function as a selective disinfection strategy to diminish bacterial culturability without damaging the cell membrane. The PI/SSL system could also effectively inhibit bacterial regrowth for >&#160;5 days and horizontal gene transfer between E. coli genera. Nontargeted metabolomic analysis suggested that PI/SSL system inactivated bacteria by triggering the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and the depletion of reduced glutathione. Additionally, the PI/SSL system could accomplish simultaneous micropollutant removal and bacterial inactivation, suggesting its versatility in water decontamination. Overall, this study deciphers more comprehensive antibacterial mechanisms of this environmentally friendly disinfection system, facilitating the technical development and application of the selective disinfection strategy in environmental pathogen control.

Whole-slide images (WSIs) of tumor tissues reflect the histopathologic information of the tumor, which is important for therapeutic response effectiveness. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether predictive information for pCR could be detected from WSIs. We retrospectively collected data from four cohorts of 874 patients diagnosed with biopsy-proven breast cancer. A deep learning pathological model (DLPM) was constructed to predict pCR using biopsy WSIs in the primary cohort, and it was then validated in three external cohorts. The DLPM could generate a deep learning pathological score (DLPs) for each patient; stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were selected for comparison with DLPs. The WSI feature-based DLPM showed good predictive performance with the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.72 among the cohorts. Alternatively, the combination of the DLPM and clinical characteristics offered a better prediction performance (AUC >0.70) in all cohorts. We also evaluated the performance of DLPM in three different breast subtypes with the best prediction for the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype (AUC: 0.73). Moreover, DLPM combined with clinical characteristics and stromal TILs achieved the highest AUC in the primary cohort (AUC: 0.82) and validation cohort 1 (AUC: 0.80). Our study suggested that WSIs integrated with deep learning could potentially predict pCR to NAC in breast cancer. The predictive performance will be improved by combining clinical characteristics. DLPs from DLPM can provide more information compared to stromal TILs for pCR prediction. ",

Standardized synoptic reporting (SR) increases both completeness and readability. In the Netherlands SR for breast cancer was introduced in 2009. We explore the impact of synoptic reporting on breast cancer care. Using data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and Dutch Nationwide Pathology Databank, a retrospective population-based cohort study was performed. Data of breast cancer resections from 2007 to 2014 were collected to compare NR and SR for all outcome measures. Kaplan-Meier analyses and log-rank testing were used to estimate overall survival. Over time there was an increase from 12% to 78.9% in the use of SR. SR resulted in higher completeness of pathology reports, particularly for hormone and HER2/neu receptor status. Although there was no difference in the administration of antihormonal therapy, anti-HER2 treatment was more frequently administered to eligible patients in the SR group. An effect on overall survival could not yet be confirmed on multivariate analysis. We demonstrate that SR has led to more complete pathology reports, which meets the needs for precision of information in breast cancer care. This is expected to improve communication and discussions between specialists regarding parameters important for adjuvant breast cancer treatment decisions. SR thereby improves breast cancer care and leads to improved allocation of treatment based on pathologic parameters and more personalized treatment regimens. ",

        "AbstractText": "Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world, and its incidence and mortality rate rank among the top malignant tumors worldwide, which has become an important killer threatening human survival rate and well-being. Modern medical treatment for lung cancer is mainly based on surgery and radiotherapy, with gene, targeted drugs and immunotherapy as auxiliary treatments, which are effective, but there are problems such as postoperative recurrence, resistance to radiotherapy, toxic side effects and poor compliance. In recent years, with the continuous development of TCM, TCM is popular among physicians and patients for its high efficiency, low toxicity, low side effects and economic benefits, etc. As a classical TCM formula, Qianjin Weijin Decoction(QJWJ) has certain value in the treatment of lung cancer. This paper summarizes and analyzes the clinical research, molecular mechanism, pharmacological effects and chemical composition of QJWJ in the treatment of lung cancer, in order to provide more ideas and theoretical basis for the treatment of lung cancer with QJWJ.

        "AbstractText": "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world, and metastasis is often the main cause of death in breast cancer patients. Salvia miltiorrhiza -Ginseng (SG) herb pair is clinically used for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and cancers. However, the pharmacological action of this pair on breast cancer is yet unclear. In this study, a spontaneous metastasis model of breast cancer was constructed to assess the therapeutic value of SG. After administration of different doses of SG, the results showed that although it did not significantly inhibit tumor growth, high-dose SG administration could inhibit tumor metastasis. Then, based on systematic pharmacology combined with Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, potential targets of drugs were identified such as vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP9), prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase2 (PTGS2), etc. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) analysis revealed that these targets were related to cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, cell migration and other biological processes and signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt, etc. The systematic pharmacology analysis showed that SG effectively inhibited the VEGFA and MMP9-mediated biological events such as angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and impaired tumor metastasis. Overall, our research aimed to provide new ideas for the treatment of breast cancer lung metastasis in traditional Chinese medicine. ",

        "AbstractText": "We assessed the effects of oral immunonutrition (OI) on the inflammatory infiltration of the tumor microenvironment (TME) of patients undergoing surgery for gastric cancer. We analyzed patients at the time of their first gastric cancer diagnosis. We collected surgical tissue specimens (stomach), and performed an immunohistochemical analysis to evaluate the inflammatory infiltration of the TME. Patients receiving OI were compared with patients receiving standard oral nutritional supplements and no nutritional support. We enrolled 12 patients with gastric cancer in the study. The median body weight loss was 5.6%. Four patients received OI, five patients received standard nutritional supplement, and three patients received no nutritional supplementation. No difference in age, body mass index (BMI), and body weight loss was observed between the three groups. The OI group showed a tendency of increased number of T-lymphocyte cluster of differentiation (CD) 8+ compared with the other groups, as well as the number of CD83+ and CD68+. The absence of F4/80+ cells was documented only in the TME of the OI group, where a linear positive correlation was present between lymphocytes CD4+ and CD8+ (R&#160;=&#160;0.48), and between CD4+ and CD83+ (R&#160;=&#160;0.89), although not statistically significant. In the OI group, we observed a positive correlation (not significant) between the number of lymphocytes CD8+ and macrophages CD68+ (R&#160;=&#160;0.70; P&#160;=&#160;0.30). A strong significant correlation was documented between CD68+ and CD40+ (R&#160;=&#160;0.99; P&#160;=&#160;0.01), but this correlation did not reach the significance among the patients of the other two groups (R&#160;=&#160;0.60; P&#160;=&#160;0.116).

        "AbstractText": "One of the challenging and the primary stages of medical image examination is the identification of the source of any disease, which may be the aberrant damage or change in tissue or organ caused by infections, injury, and a variety of other factors. Any such condition related to skin or brain sometimes advances in cancer and becomes a life-threatening disease. So, an efficient automatic image segmentation approach is required at the initial stage of medical image analysis. To make a segmentation process efficient and reliable, it is essential to use an appropriate objective function and an efficient optimization algorithm to produce optimal results. The above problem is resolved in this paper by introducing a new minimum generalized cross entropy (MGCE) as an objective function, with the inclusion of the degree of divergence. Another key contribution is the development of a new optimizer called opposition African vulture optimization algorithm (OAVOA). The proposed optimizer boosted the exploration, skill by inheriting the opposition-based learning. The experimental work in this study starts with a performance evaluation of the optimizer over a set of standards (23 numbers) and IEEE CEC14 (8 numbers) Benchmark functions. The comparative analysis of test results shows that the OAVOA outperforms different state-of-the-art optimizers. The suggested OAVOA-MGCE based multilevel thresholding approach is carried out on two different types of medical images - Brain MRI Images (AANLIB dataset), and dermoscopic images (ISIC 2016 dataset) and found superior than other entropy-based thresholding methods.

        "AbstractText": "A new sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor for the sensitive detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was originally developed using a unique bismuth (Bi)-gold (Au) nano-electrocatalyst triggering efficient capture of tumor marker, where the nano-electrocatalyst was obtained by implanting Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) inside the mesoporous NBiOF nanospheres (Au@NBOF NSs) for the purpose to marker secondary antibody (Ab2) and amplify the response signal through electrochemically catalyzing the reduction of hydrogen peroxide. The synergistic interaction between NBOF NSs and Au NPs endowed the as-received Au@NBOF nano-electrocatalyst with large electrocatalytic active surface area and powerful signal amplification function as upper sandwich layer to conjugate Ab2. The multi-walled carbon nanotubes sparkled with Au nanostars served as the lower sandwich layer to capture the primary antibody (Ab1), which enhanced the interfacial electron transport and the load capacity of Ab1 as a result of increasing the sensing response of the designed immunosensor based on the sandwich-type Ab1-CEA-Ab2 interaction. Such immunosensor proposed on the above double signal amplification strategy efficiently detected the target CEA in a wide concentration range from 100 fg mL-1 to 200&#160;ng&#160;mL-1. The detection limit was as low as 9.57 fg mL-1 with excellent specificity and reproducibility. The satisfactory results in analyzing human serum samples indicate the potential application of this new immunosensor in early clinical diagnosis of cancer and the evaluation of treatment efficiency.

        "ArticleTitle": "Wasserstein-based texture analysis in radiomic studies. ",
        "AbstractText": "The emerging field of radiomics that transforms standard-of-care images to quantifiable scalar statistics endeavors to reveal the information hidden in these macroscopic images. The concept of texture is widely used and essential in many radiomic-based studies. Practice usually reduces spatial multidimensional texture matrices, e.g., gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCMs), to summary scalar features. These statistical features have been demonstrated to be strongly correlated and tend to contribute redundant information; and does not account for the spatial information hidden in the multivariate texture matrices. This study proposes a novel pipeline to deal with spatial texture features in radiomic studies. A new set of textural features that preserve the spatial information inherent in GLCMs is proposed and used for classification purposes. The set of the new features uses the Wasserstein metric from optimal mass transport theory (OMT) to quantify the spatial similarity between samples within a given label class. In particular, based on a selected subset of texture GLCMs from the training cohort, we propose new representative spatial texture features, which we incorporate into a supervised image classification pipeline. The pipeline relies on the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm along with Bayesian optimization and the Wasserstein metric. The selection of the best GLCM references is considered for each classification label and is performed during the training phase of the SVM classifier using a Bayesian optimizer. We assume that sample fitness is defined based on closeness (in the sense of the Wasserstein metric) and high correlation (Spearman's rank sense) with other samples in the same class. Moreover, the newly defined spatial texture features consist of the Wasserstein distance between the optimally selected references and the remaining samples. We assessed the performance of the proposed classification pipeline in diagnosing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from computed tomographic (CT) images. To evaluate the proposed spatial features' added value, we compared the performance of the proposed classification pipeline with other SVM-based classifiers that account for different texture features, namely: statistical features only, optimized spatial features using Euclidean metric, non-optimized spatial features with Wasserstein metric. The proposed technique, which accounts for the optimized spatial texture feature with Wasserstein metric, shows great potential in classifying new COVID CT images that the algorithm has not seen in the training step. The MATLAB code of the proposed classification pipeline is made available. It can be used to find the best reference samples in other data cohorts, which can then be employed to build different prediction models. ",

EM was prepared by serial extrusion of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), ammonium sulfate gradient method was used to promote the active loading of doxorubicin, and EM-Dox was obtained after removal of free doxorubicin by dialysis. The obtained EM and EM-Dox were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), Western Blot assay(WB), and the yield of exosomes and EM was further compared. Confocal fluorescent microscopy was used to verify the uptake of EM-Dox and free doxorubicin (Free-Dox) by NB cells. CCK-8 assay, cell cycle assay, and cell apoptosis assay were used to evaluate the antitumor effect of EM-Dox on NB cells in vitro. In addition, the targeted therapeutic effect and biosafety of EM-Dox against NB were evaluated in tumor-bearing nude mice. TEM, NTA, and WB verified that both EM and EM-Dox feature highly similar morphology, size and marker protein expression in comparison with naturally occurred exosomes, but the particle size of EM-Dox increased slightly after loading doxorubicin. The protein yield and particle yield of EM-Dox were 16.8 and 26.3-folds higher than those of exosomes, respectively. Confocal fluorescent microscopy showed that EM and doxorubicin had a definite co-localization. EM-Dox was readily internalized in two well-established human NB cell lines. The intracellular content of doxorubicin in cells treated with EM-Dox was significantly higher than that treated with Free-Dox. CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry confirmed that EM-Dox could inhibit NB cell proliferation, induce G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, and promote NB cell apoptosis in vitro. In vivo bioluminescence imaging results demonstrated that EM-Dox effectively targets NB tumors in vivo. Compared with Free-Dox, EM-Dox had a significantly increased inhibitory effect against NB tumor proliferation and progression in vivo, without inducing any myocardial injury. EM-Dox showed significantly increased anti-tumor activity in comparison with free doxorubicin in vitro and in vivo, and scalable EMs may represent a new class of NanoDDS that can potentially replace naturally occurred exosomes in preclinical or clinical translations.

The recently identified C797S mutation causes resistance of EGFRL858R/T790M against osimertinib, the latest approved third generation EGFR inhibitor. The identification of small molecules capable of selectively inhibiting the T790M mutations also in the late-onset C797S mutation is a desirable strategy and novel chemical structures might provide new insight in the overcoming resistance mechanisms. Here we report the identification of a novel mutant-selective privileged molecular core; guided by a structure-based drug design, a flavone skeleton has been rationally modified, and a virtual library generated. Reversible EGFR inhibitors targeting both L858R/T790M and L858R/T790M/C797S mutations with a higher affinity with respect to the wild type one are discovered via a three-track virtual screening. Selected hits were synthesized and tested in an activity-based enzyme assay against wild-type EGFR, L858R/T790M, as well as L858R/T790M/C797S. The results showed that a nitroflavone-based compound inhibits the phosphorylation of EGFR mutants at low-micromolar concentration showing selectivity over the wild type ones.

Thus, the efficacy of radiomic profiles compared to conventional strategies to predict pCR are inconclusive. Comparing the predictive accuracy of different breast MRI radiomic protocols to identify the optimal strategy in predicting pCR to NAC. A systematic review and network meta-analysis was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Four databases were searched up to October 4th, 2021.

        "AbstractText": "Exosomal proteins are considered to be promising indicators of cancer. Herein, a novel DNAzyme walkers-triggered CRISPR-Cas12a/Cas13a strategy was proposed for the synchronous determination of exosomal proteins: serum amyloid A-1 protein (SAA1) and coagulation factor V (FV). In this design, the paired antibodies were used to recognize targets, thereby ensuring the specificity. DNAzyme walkers were employed to convert the contents of SAA1 and FV into activators (P1 and P2), and one target can produce abundant activators, thus achieving an initial amplification of signal. Furthermore, the P1 and P2 can activate CRISPR-Cas12a/Cas13a system, which in turn trans-cleaves the reporters, enabling a second amplification and generating two fluorescent signals. The assay is highly sensitive (limits of detection as low as 30.00&#160;pg/mL for SAA1 and 200.00&#160;pg/mL for FV), highly specific and ideally accurate. More importantly, it is universal and can be used to detect both non-membrane and membrane proteins in exosome. Besides, the method can be successfully applied to detect SAA1 and FV in plasma exosomes to differentiate between lung cancer patients and healthy individuals. To explore the application of the developed method in tumor diagnosis, a deep learning model based on the expressions of SAA1 and FV was developed. The accuracy of this model can achieve 86.96%, which proves that it has a promising practical application capacity.

Since immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has been approved for treatment of tumours with defective mismatch repair the interplay between DDR pathway deficiency and the immune system has been of particular interest. The cGAS/STING signalling pathway has recently emerged as a key mediator of inflammation in response to DNA damage.This was identified through transcriptional profiling of BRCA1/2 deficient breast cancers and Fanconi Anaemia (FA) patient bone marrow, revealing a common transcriptional subgroup associated with BRCA1/2 and FA deficiency characterised by upregulation of innate immune signalling genes. Additionally, it is now apparent that the DNA damage arising from a multitude of DNA repair defects and DNA damage induced by some classical chemotherapies/radiation also has the ability to induce an innate immune response mediated by cGAS/STING activation.

        "AbstractText": "Recent increased awareness and research studies reflect possible associations between opioid exposure and cancer outcomes. Children with neuroblastoma (NB) often require opioid treatment for pain. However, associations between tumor response to chemotherapy and opioid exposure have not been investigated in clinical settings. This is a single-institution retrospective review of patients with NB treated between 2013 and 2016. We evaluated opioid consumption quantified in morphine equivalent doses (mg/kg) based on nurse- or patient-controlled analgesia during antibody infusions. We also analyzed their associations with change in primary tumor volume and total tumor burden. Of 42 patients given opioids for pain related to anti-disialoganglioside monoclonal antibodies (anti-GD2 mAb), data completion was achieved for 36, and details of statistical analyses were entered. Median total weight-based morphine equivalent (over 8&#160;days) was 4.71&#160;mg/kg (interquartile range 3.49-7.96). We found a statistically insignificant weak negative relationship between total weight-based morphine equivalents and tumor volume ratio (correlation coefficient -.0103, p-value .9525) and a statistically insignificant weak positive relationship between total weight-based morphine equivalent and Curie score ratio (correlation coefficient .1096, p-value .5247). Our study found no statistically significant correlation between opioid consumption and natural killer (NK) cell-mediated killing of NB cells as measured by effects on tumor volume/tumor load. ",

Content analysis of semi-structured interviews among AYAs aged 12-39 years with advanced cancer, caregivers, and clinicians was used to evaluate transcripts. Coded excerpts were reviewed to identify themes related to normalcy. Participants included 23 AYAs with advanced cancer, 28 caregivers, and 29 clinicians. Participants identified five domains of normalcy including relationships, activities, career/school, milestones, and appearance. AYAs and caregivers identified that clinicians facilitate normalcy through exploration of these domains with AYAs, allowing flexibility in care plans, identification of short-term and long-term goals across normalcy domains, and recognizing losses of normalcy that occur during cancer care. AYAs with cancer experience multiple threats to normalcy during advanced cancer care. Clinicians can attend to normalcy and improve AYA quality of life by acknowledging these losses through ongoing discussions on how best to support domains of normalcy and by reinforcing AYA identities beyond a cancer diagnosis.

While numerous studies report on viral infections in children with hematologic malignancies and solid organ transplantation, epidemiologic data on the incidence and outcome of viral infections in pediatric patients with brain tumors treated with targeted therapies are still lacking. We retrospectively reviewed all children with brain tumors receiving targeted therapies in a primary or recurrent setting at the Medical University of Vienna from 2006 to 2021. Demographic variables, quantitative and qualitative parameters of possible infections, and treatment outcomes were recorded. In our cohort (n&#160;=&#160;117), 36% of the patients developed at least one PCR-proven viral infection. Respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections were most common, with 31% and 25%, respectively. Central nervous system (CNS) infections occurred in approximately 10%, with an almost equal distribution of varicella-zoster virus, John Cunningham virus (JCV), and enterovirus. Two patients tested PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, with one virus-related death caused by a SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome. Patients receiving bevacizumab or mTOR inhibitors seem to have a greater susceptibility to viral infections. Pediatric patients with brain tumors receiving targeted therapies have a higher risk of viral infections when compared to children receiving conventional chemotherapy or the general population, and life-threatening infections can occur. Fast detection and upfront treatment are paramount to prevent life-threatening infections in immunocompromised children suffering from brain tumors receiving targeted therapies. ",

Molecular profiling data from the American Association for Cancer Research GENIE registry was accessed for 23 patients with angiomyolipomas, and 9 of 16 patients with eAMLs in our institutional registry were evaluated with next-generation sequencing. IHC was performed to screen for alterations of P53, RB, and ATRX for all 16 institutional cases. Combined alterations of 5 tumor-suppressor genes (TP53, ATRX, RB1, APC, and NF1) were identified using next-generation sequencing in 7 of 8 (88%) patients with metastatic disease compared to a single patient with nonmetastatic disease (RB1 variant of uncertain significance; 1 of 24, 4%). No cases with abnormal IHC results were identified in 11 patients with nonmetastatic disease compared to 3 of 5 patients with metastatic disease. Our results show that the majority of metastatic eAMLs have mutations of 5 tumor-suppressor genes (TP53, ATRX, RB1, APC, and NF1), while these are rare in patients with nonmetastatic disease. Furthermore, IHC for P53, RB, and ATRX may serve as a screen for a subset of these alterations in resource-limited settings.

So, this study was conducted to assess the utility of upper GI endoscopy to investigate alarm features in dyspepsia patients less than 60 years of age to exclude upper GI neoplasia. This prospective observational study evaluated consecutive patients of dyspepsia between 18 and 60 years of age, with at least one or more of the alarm symptoms (unintentional weight loss; loss of appetite; GI bleeding; anemia; recurrent or persistent vomiting; dysphagia with predominant epigastric pain; and family history of upper GI cancer) with upper GI endoscopy to exclude any organic lesion and malignancy. Of total 294 patients evaluated with endoscopy, 34.7% (n=102) had normal endoscopy (functional dyspepsia [FD]) while 65.3% (n=192) had abnormal endoscopic findings (organic dyspepsia [OD]).

Clinicopathologic characteristics were compared by Borrmann type. Logistic regression models were fit to analyze the relationship between Borrmann type and pCR rate. Of the 227 patients who underwent gastrectomy during the period studied, 73 had pretreatment endoscopic images available for analysis. We classified the tumors as follows: Borrmann type 1, 4 (6%); type 2, 17 (23%); type 3, 33 (45%); and type 4, 19 (26%). Nine patients (12%) achieved pCR; 6 of these (67%) had type 1/2 GC and 3 (33%) had type 3.

Herein, the objective of our study is to probe into the potential function as well as the underlying mechanism of KCNQ1OT1 on hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury (HIRI). Using C57BL/6&#160;J mice and primary mouse hepatocytes were conducted to establish HIRI model in vivo and in vitro. Cell viability was examined using CCK-8 assay and EdU assay. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to evaluate the pyroptosis. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was employed to verify the interaction relationships. qRT-PCR and Western blot were adopted to analyze the mRNA and protein level. Histopathological alteration of liver tissue was evaluated by HE staining. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to measure NLRP3 and caspase 1. Our data revealed that KCNQ1OT1 expression was ascending in hepatic tissue of HIRI mouse. Moreover, deprivation of KCNQ1OT1 mitigated I/R-induced hepatic injury and pyroptosis in vivo. Further experiments demonstrated that silencing KCNQ1OT1 promoted proliferation and inhibited pyroptosis in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced primary mouse hepatocytes. Mechanistically, KCNQ1OT1 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA which sponged miR-142a-3p, therefore promoted HMGB1 expression to activate TLR4/NF-&#954;B signaling pathway in HIRI.

In The Christmas Tree (1981), the home is both haven and prison for Johnston's heroine. In this paper, I argue that the home-which assumes the form of the individual body and the familial home-is paradoxical. The protagonist leaves 1950s Ireland because of the country's rigid gender roles in order to pursue an autonomous life as a writer in England, but she is unable to publish her writing within the confines of the patriarchal publishing world. The home of her body becomes paradoxical when she becomes a single mother as an avenue for creativity but is then diagnosed with terminal cancer. She returns to her father's home to die, which she re-orders and reclaims through the disorder of the uncanny-represented by her non-conformity and illness brought into the patriarchal home. By writing her life story and creating a brief, alternative maternal relationship with her young caretaker, the protagonist confronts her own ambivalence toward her parents, who also represent aspects of oppressive heteronormative gender expectations.

This study aimed to understand how CDC-funded Colorectal Cancer Control Program recipients and their partner health systems and clinics may have modified evidence-based intervention (EBI) implementation to promote CRC screening during the COVID-19 pandemic; to identify barriers and facilitators to implementing modifications; and to extract lessons that can be applied to support CRC screening, chronic disease management, and clinic resilience in the face of future public health crises. Nine recipients were selected to reflect the diversity inherent among all CRCCP recipients. Recipient and clinic partner staff answered unique sets of pre-interview questions to inform tailoring of interview guides that were developed using constructs from the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications to Evidence-based Implementation Strategies (FRAME-IS) and Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). The study team then interviewed recipient, health system, and clinic partner staff incorporating pre-interview responses to focus each conversation. We employed a rapid qualitative analysis approach then conducted virtual focus groups with recipient representatives to validate emergent themes. Three modifications that emerged from thematic analysis include: (1) offering mailed fecal immunochemical test (FIT) kits for CRC screening with mail or drop off return; (2) increasing the use of patient education and engagement strategies; and (3) increasing the use of or improving automated patient messaging systems. With improved tracking and automated reminder systems, mailed FIT kits paired with tailored patient education and clear instructions for completing the test could help primary care clinics catch up on the backlog of missed screenings during COVID-19.

However, the therapy effects of phototherapy are often compromised by the hypoxia, high levels of hydrogen peroxide, and glutathione of tumor microenvironment (TME). Therefore, we constructed a catalase-like activity bionic metal-organic framework drugs delivery system (FA-EM@MnO2/ZIF-8/ICG) with tumor microenvironment controllable releasing. In this system, photosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG) was introduced into zeolite imidazole salt skeleton 8 (ZIF-8) by one-step methods, forming ZIF-8/ICG nano-platform, which can effectively avoid ICG-induced phototoxicity and aggregation-induced quenching during transport. MnO2 with catalase-like activity was coated on the surface of ZIF-8/ICG nano-platform, which made it have the ability of self-supplying O2 under the condition of H2O2 in TME. Exposure under near-infrared light can alleviate the anoxic TME, thus improving the phototherapy efficiency. In addition, folate-functionalized erythrocyte membrane is coated on the surface of MnO2/ZIF-8/ICG, which can endow FA-EM@MnO2/ZIF-8/ICG with the ability of targeted drug administration and immune elimination avoidance. Therefore, FA-EM@MnO2/ZIF-8/ICG nano-platform has the catalase-like activity, which can alleviate the oxidative stress state of TME and provide a beneficial environment for photodynamic therapy of tumor.

It is possible to employ reliable biomarkers to diagnose cancer in the early stages, predict the patient prognosis, follow up the response to treatment, and estimate the risk of disease recurrence with high sensitivity and specificity. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), especially exosomes, have been the focus of translational research to develop such biomarkers over the past decade. The abundance and distribution of exosomes in bodily fluids, including serum, saliva, and urine, as well as their ability to transport various biomolecules (nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids) derived from their parent cells, make exosomes reliable, accessible, and potent biomarkers for diagnosis and follow-up of solid and hematopoietic tumors. In addition, exosomes play a vital role in various cellular processes, including tumor progression, by participating in intercellular communication. Although these advantages underline the high potential of tumor-derived exosomes as diagnostic biomarkers, the lack of standardized effective methods for their isolation, identification, and precise characterization makes their application challenging in clinical settings. We discuss the importance of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in cellular processes, and the role of tumor-derived exosomes containing ncRNAs as potential biomarkers in several types of cancer.

        "AbstractText": "Mitochondrial dynamics are balanced fission and fusion events that regulate mitochondrial morphology, and alteration in these events results in mitochondrial dysfunction and contributes to many diseases, including tumorigenesis. Ovarian cancer (OC) cells exhibit fragmented mitochondria, but the mechanism by which mitochondrial dynamics regulators contribute to OC is considerably less clear. Here, we elucidated the potential role of Mfn2-mediated mitochondrial fusion in OC and present evidence that genetic or pharmacological activation of Mfn2 leads to mitochondrial fusion and reduces ROS generation, which correlates with reduced cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and EMT in OC cells. Also, increased mitochondrial fusion promotes the F-actin remodeling, reduces lamellipodia formation, and thus reduces EMT. Increased expression of Mfn2 triggers AMPK, promotes autophagy, reduces ROS,&#160;and&#160;suppresses OC progression by downregulating&#160; the p-mTOR (2481 and 2448) and p-ERK axis.

In July 2022, pucotenlimab received conditional first approval in China for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) solid tumours, including patients with advanced colorectal cancer who have experienced disease progression after previous therapy with fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and irinotecan, as well as patients with other advanced solid tumours who have experienced disease progression after previous first-line therapy and have no satisfactory treatment alternatives. In September 2022, pucotenlimab was approved in China for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanomas after the failure of previous systemic therapy. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of pucotenlimab leading to the first approval for the treatment of MSI-H/dMMR advanced solid tumours. ",

        "AbstractText": "Landmark artery identification in the neurovascular bundle (NVB) is important for nerve-sparing in radical prostatectomy. We aimed to investigate intraoperative angiography using indocyanine green and near-infrared fluorescence (ICG-NIRF) during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) to identify the NVB, visualise vascularisation and haemostasis, and preserve erectile function. Our&#160;retrospective, unicentric study was performed in consecutive localised prostate cancer RARP patients (stage T1/T2, prostate-specific antigen&#8201;<&#8201;10&#160;ng/ml) who underwent ICG-NIRF angiography in France (2016-2021). When ready to dissect the NVB, the anaesthesiologist intravenously injected ICG (3&#160;ml); the surgeon used alternating standard light or fluorescence to optimise NVB visualisation and facilitate microdissection. Primary outcomes: safety and feasibility of ICG-NIRF. Secondary outcomes: functional erectile dysfunction (Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM)&#160;questionnaire) over 9&#160;months, proportion of bilateral NVBs identified, ICG-related complications. Standard descriptive statistics were used; t test determined the significance of changes in SHIM scores versus baseline. Ninety-one patients received intraoperative angiography. The NVB was identified in all cases, without difficulties. No ICG-related complications or allergies were observed. There was no significant difference in the SHIM score at 9&#160;months compared with baseline (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.331), and erectile dysfunction returned to baseline levels in almost all patients. Intraoperative, real-time ICG-NIRF angiography is simple, non-invasive, and improves identification of key anatomical landmarks to optimise micropreservation of the NVB during RARP and preserve erectile function. Larger clinical studies should confirm preliminary results. ",

        "AbstractText": "The objective of the current study was to develop and test the performances of different ML algorithms which were trained using patient-reported symptom severity data to predict mortality within 180&#160;days for patients with advanced cancer. We randomly selected 630 of 689 patients with advanced cancer at our institution who completed symptom PRO measures as part of routine care between 2009 and 2020. Using clinical, demographic, and PRO data, we trained and tested four ML algorithms: generalized regression with elastic net regularization (GLM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) trees, support vector machines (SVM), and a single hidden layer neural network (NNET). We assessed the performance of algorithms individually as well as part of an unweighted voting ensemble on the hold-out testing sample. Performance was assessed using area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). The starting cohort of 630 patients was randomly partitioned into training (n&#8201;=&#8201;504) and testing (n&#8201;=&#8201;126) samples. Of the four ML models, the XGBoost algorithm demonstrated the best performance for 180-day mortality prediction in testing data (AUROC&#8201;=&#8201;0.69, sensitivity&#8201;=&#8201;0.68, specificity&#8201;=&#8201;0.62, PPV&#8201;=&#8201;0.66, NPV&#8201;=&#8201;0.64).

        "AbstractText": "High levels of methionine (Met) and its metabolites, such as methionine sulfoxide (MetO), found in hypermethioninemia, can be detrimental to the body; however, the underlying mechanisms are still uncertain. Using a recently standardized protocol, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of chronic administration of Met and/or MetO on parameters of oxidative damage in the total brain, liver, and kidney of young mice. Swiss male mice were subcutaneously injected with Met and MetO at concentrations of 0.35-1.2&#160;g/kg body weight and 0.09-0.3&#160;g/kg body weight, respectively, from the 10th-38th day post-birth, while the control group was treated with saline solution. Results showed that Met and/or MetO caused an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipoperoxidation, along with a reduction of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in the brain. In the liver, Met and/or MetO enhanced ROS and nitrite levels, and reduced SOD, CAT, and delta aminolevulinic dehydratase activities. The effects on the kidney were an increase in ROS production and SOD activity, and a reduction in thiol content and CAT activity. These data demonstrated the contribution of redox imbalance to the systemic changes found in patients with hypermethioninemia. In conclusion, our findings may help future studies to better understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of hypermethioninemia as well as contribute to the search for new therapeutic agents for this pathology.

        "AbstractText": "The paper examines the use of natural antioxidant and anti-inflammation substances as therapeutic candidates for brain disease. Para-coumaric acid (pCA), a phenolic compound with a variety of medicinal properties, was used against deterioration caused by various diseases. Recently, pCA has gained attention for use against cardiovascular disease but less so for neurodegenerative disease (i.e., Parkinson's disease). Therefore, the present study intended to investigate the effect of pCA against rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease-like pathology in mice. Thirty male institute of cancer research (ICR) mice were randomly divided into three experimental groups: Sham-veh, Rot-veh, and Rot-pCA100. Rotenone (Rot) 2.5&#160;mg/kg was subcutaneously injected every 48&#160;h in the rotenone groups. Alternately, a 100&#160;mg/kg pCA dose was given every 48&#160;h via intragastric gavage to the Rot-pCA100 group for 6&#160;weeks. Motor ability was assessed at the second, fourth, and sixth week before brain collection for biochemical and histological analyses. Results indicated significant motor deficits appeared from the second to sixth week after rotenone injection. Brain analysis detected a significant effect of rotenone in the increase of malondialdehyde and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;). This result was observed in accordance with a reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and an increase of neuronal degeneration in the substantia nigra par compacta (SNc) and striatum. However, pCA was able to reverse all of the deterioration (i.e., reduced malondialdehyde and TNF-&#945;) rotenone had caused, and it protected against TH and neuronal loss in the SNc and striatum. Therefore, the present study has depicted the neuroprotective effect of pCA against rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease-like pathology in mice. Benefits of pCA include anti-lipid peroxidation and anti-inflammatory effects, inhibition of neurodegeneration, and a nurturing effect on the TH level in the SNc and striatum, leading to mitigation of motor deficits.

        "AbstractText": "Cancer is recognized globally as the second-most dominating and leading cause of morbidities. Fighting the global health epidemic threat posed by cancer requires progress and improvements in imaging techniques, surgical techniques, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The existence of a small subpopulation of undifferentiated cells known as cancer stem cells has been supported by accumulating evidence and ongoing research. According to clinical data, cancer recurrence, tumor development, and metastasis are thought to be caused by CSCs. Nutritional or dietary supplements can help you to fight against cancer and cope with the treatment side effects. Vitamin D, sometimes known as the sunshine vitamin, is produced in the skin in reaction to sunlight. Vitamin D deficiency is hazardous to any degree, increasing the risk of diseases such as cancer and disorders like osteoporosis. Bioactive vitamin D, or calcitriol, regulates several biological pathways. Many modes of action of Vitamin D might be helpful in protecting somatic stem cells (e.g., DNA damage repair and oxidative stress protection) or restricting cancer stem cell growth (e.g., cell cycle arrest, cell apoptosis). Researchers have recently begun to investigate the inhibitory effects of dietary vitamin D on cancer stem cells. In this review, we investigated the therapeutic impact of vitamin D and its molecular processes to target cancer and cancer stem cells as well. ",

        "AbstractText": "Cerulenin is a fungal metabolite and a specific inhibitor of fatty acid synthase (FASN), which has shown a potential anticancer activity. 20-25% of breast cancer patients with ErbB2-overexpressing develop resistance to treatment. Therefore, it is urgent to find an effective new target for the treatment of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer. Our previous study found that cerulenin inhibits the glycolysis and migration of SK-BR-3 cells, but the effect of cerulenin on other malignant phenotypes of breast cancer is still unknown. Furthermore, the mechanism by which cerulenin displays its inhibitory effects is not fully understood. In this study, we systematically investigate the inhibitory effects of cerulenin on proliferation, migration, invasion and glycolysis of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells and its molecular mechanism. We found that cerulenin obviously suppresses the proliferation, migration, invasion as well as glycolysis. Through bioinformatic analyses, we found that PKM2 might be a target of cerulenin. In addition, ErbB2 and its signaling pathway upregulated PKM2 protein levels. Furthermore, we demonstrated that cerulenin downregulated the protein levels of ErbB2, PKM2 and EMT markers (MMP9, MMP2 and Snail2) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Finally, the inhibitory of cerulenin on colony formation, migration, invasion and glycolysis, as well as protein levels of EMT markers were rescued by replenishing with PKM2. These findings illustrated that cerulenin inhibits proliferation, migration, invasion and glycolysis by targeting ErbB2/PKM2 pathway in ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. ",

        "AbstractText": "Cellular c-FLIP prevents apoptosis mediated by death receptor through inhibiting activation of caspase-8. Therefore, when c-FLIP is downregulated or eliminated, caspase-8 activation is promoted, and death receptor ligand-induced apoptosis is activated. It was reported that triptolide (TPL) sensitized tumor cells to TNF-&#945;-induced apoptosis by blocking TNF-&#945;-induced activation of NF-&#954;B and transcription of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2. However, the effect of TPL on basal c-FLIP expression was not understood. In this study, we found that the combination of TNF-&#945; and TPL accelerated apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and TNF-&#945;-induced elevated as well as basal level of FLIPS protein were downregulated by TPL. Additionally, we demonstrated that the basal level of FLIPS in Huh7 cells was continuously downregulated following the incubation of TPL and downregulated more when dosage of TPL for treatment was increased. Subsequently, we showed that TPL reduced FLIPS level in a transcription- and degradation-independent mechanism. Our findings suggest that TPL induces loss of FLIPS at the post-transcriptional level independently of proteasome-mediated pathway, an additional mechanism of TPL sensitizing cancer cells to TNF-&#945;-induced apoptosis.

        "AbstractText": "The presence of Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) has been proven to be correlated with disease progression and the patient's response to treatment. However, the culture of CTCs for clinical utility is still a big challenge. We have developed a short-term method that enables CTCs culture and provides an opportunity to monitor drug susceptibility testing in individual patients. In a proof-of-concept study, we established a unique method using Matrigel&#174; coated in 96 well plate to enable cancer cell clusters to attach and proliferate. The culture method using Matrigel&#174; provides in vitro conditions and improves the attachment and differentiation of anchorage-dependent epithelial cells proliferation and mimics the tumor microenvironment. We further treated the cells attached to Matrigel&#174; with the same drug regimen as the patient has undergone. Around 30.7% of the CTCs were viable after the drug treatment. We also correlated the decrease in cell viability after drug treatment with the reduction in the pleural effusion of the patient as seen by the images obtained from CT scans pre-and post-treatment. Moreover, as per the RECIST criterion, the patient had exhibited a positive response to the treatment. The short-term culturing of CTC along with the drug susceptibility testing offers a novel method to predict patient response to the treatment and could be utilized for screening suitable drug combinations for personalized treatment.

        "AbstractText": "Through their role in energy generation and regulation of several vital pathways, including apoptosis and inflammation, mitochondria are critical for the life of eukaryotic organisms. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a major problem implicated in the etiology of many pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and many others. Proteotoxic stress, here defined as a reduction in bioenergetic activity induced by the accumulation of aberrant proteins in the mitochondria, is likely to be implicated in disease-linked mitochondrial and cellular decline. Various quality control pathways, such as mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR), the ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent degradation of aberrant mitochondrial proteins, and mitochondria-specific autophagy (mitophagy), respond to proteotoxic stress and eliminate defective proteins or dysfunctional mitochondria. This work provides a concise review of mechanisms by which disease-linked aberrant proteins affect mitochondrial function and an overview of mitochondrial quality control pathways that counteract mitochondrial proteotoxicity. We focus on mitochondrial quality control mechanisms relying on the Ub-mediated protein degradation, such as mitochondria-specific autophagy and the mitochondrial arm of the Ub proteasome system (UPS). We highlight the importance of a widening perspective of how these pathways protect mitochondria from proteotoxic stress to better understand mitochondrial proteotoxicity in overlapping pathophysiological pathways. Implications of these mechanisms in disease development are also briefly summarized. ",

In ovarian cancer, mutations or amplifications frequently occur in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway components, and dysregulation of this pathway is shown among the causes of treatment failure. In the present study, it was aimed to investigate the anti-cancer properties of boron-containing DPD in SKOV3 cells, which is an epithelial ovarian cancer model, through PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. The cytotoxic activity of DPD in SKOV3 cells was evaluated by WST-1 test, apoptotic effect by Annexin V and JC-1 test. The gene expressions associated with PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway were determined by real-time qRT-PCR. In SKOV3 cells, the IC50 value of DPD was found to be 6.7&#160;mM, 5.6&#160;mM, and 5.2&#160;mM at 24th, 48th and 72nd hour, respectively. Compared with the untreated control group, DPD treatment was found to induce apoptosis 2.6-fold and increase mitochondrial membrane depolarization 4.5-fold. DPD treatment was found to downregulate PIK3CA, PIK3CG, AKT2, IGF1, IRS1, MAPK3, HIF-1, VEGFC, CAB39, CAB39L, STRADB, PRKAB2, PRKAG3, TELO2, RICTOR, MLST8, and EIF4B genes and upregulate TP53, GSK3B, FKBP8, TSC2, ULK1, and ULK2 genes.

Latent class analysis was performed on demoralization profiles. Binary logistic regression and multiple stepwise linear regression were used to examine the identified classes' associations with depression and QOL. Three latent classes of demoralization were identified: the \"low demoralization and emotional disturbance\" class (Class 1; 49.6%); \"moderate demoralization and meaninglessness\" class (Class 2; 29.1%); and \"high demoralization and existential despair\" class (Class 3; 21.3%).

However, studies on CXCR4 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumor immune microenvironment, including those determining its immune efficacy and prognostic potential, are still scarce. Therefore, in this study, we determined the ability of CXCR4 to predict immunotherapy response and prognosis in NSCLC using immunohistochemical staining and RT-PCR, respectively, in two independent cohorts from the National Cancer Center of China. We analyzed transcriptome sequencing data and clinical information from multiple public databases to assess immune cell infiltration in NSCLC and constructed immune risk prognostic signatures based on CXCR4-related immunomodulators. We found that immune cell infiltration is significant differences in NSCLC tissues and is moderately correlated with CXCR4 expression. High CXCR4 expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis in NSCLC patients and a higher response rate to immunotherapy. The ROC curve showed that CXCR4 expression exhibited excellent performance in predicting the efficacy of immunotherapy in NSCLC. We identified 30 CXCR4-related immunomodulators in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and constructed immune prognostic signatures based on CXCR4-related immunomodulators and CXCR4-related mutant genes. The signature-based prognostic risk score showed good performance in predicting patient prognosis in both LUAD and LUSC; high risk scores were significantly associated with poor prognosis (P&#8201;<&#8201;0.0001) and was established as an independent prognostic factor by multivariate Cox regression.

These characteristics outweigh the relatively low sensitivity and resolution of NMR in metabolomics applications. Since biological mixtures are highly complex, increased demand for new methods to improve detection, better identify unknown metabolites, and provide more accurate quantitation continues unabated. Technological and methodological advances to date have helped to improve the resolution and sensitivity and detection of a larger number of metabolite signals. Efforts focused on measuring unknown metabolite signals have resulted in the identification and quantitation of an expanded pool of metabolites including labile metabolites such as cellular redox coenzymes, energy coenzymes, and antioxidants.

Among them, 442 were treated with ICI&#8201;+&#8201;chemotherapy (48%), whereas 477 were treated with other therapies (52%). Among these 477 patients, 340 did not receive ICI&#8201;+&#8201;chemotherapy because of intolerance (71%); thus, more than one-third of the advanced NSCLC patients do not benefit from the combination therapy due to intolerance. Among the 659 NSCLC patients for whom PD-L1 was&#8201;<&#8201;50% or unknown, only 342 received the ICI&#8201;+&#8201;chemotherapy combination (52%) even though it is considered preferable to either therapy alone; the remaining 318 patients were treated with other therapies (48%). Among the 318 patients who did not receive ICI&#8201;+&#8201;chemotherapy, 274 were intolerant to it (86%). Our results revealed that a substantial proportion of advanced NSCLC patients did not benefit from ICI&#8201;+&#8201;chemotherapy due to intolerance. As treatments for NSCLC are moving toward combinations for greater efficacy, their feasibility in clinical practice must be taken into consideration. ",

        "AbstractText": "A 54-year-old postmenopausal woman was diagnosed with adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACCA) of the right breast. She had complaints of pain in the upper quadrant of the right breast, stress, disturbed sleep, and depression. Her self-reported pain intensity using the visual analog scale (VAS) was 8 and her perceived stress scale value was 19. Her depression score on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was 12. Her quality of sleep, evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), was 18. She was given integrated naturopathy and yoga therapy for 43 days. She showed a reduction in pain, stress, and depression scores. Her quality of sleep also improved after the integrated naturopathy and yoga therapy. Our structured integrated naturopathy and yoga therapy improved pain, stress, depression, and sleep quality in a postmenopausal breast cancer patient and may be used as adjuvant therapy for patients with breast cancer.

        "AbstractText": "Meningiomas are frequently occurring, often benign intracranial tumors. Molecular fluorescence can be used to intraoperatively identify residual meningioma tissue and optimize safe resection; however, currently no clinically approved agent is available for this specific tumor type. In meningiomas, vascular endothelial growth factor &#945; (VEGF&#945;) is upregulated, and this biomarker could be targeted with bevacizumab-IRDye800CW, a fluorescent agent that is already clinically applied for the resection of other tumors and neoplasms. Here, the authors investigated the feasibility of using bevacizumab-IRDye800CW to target VEGF&#945; in a CH-157MN xenografted mouse model. Five mice with CH-157MN xenografts with volumes of 500 mm3 were administered intravenous bevacizumab-IRDye800CW. Mice were imaged in vivo at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after injection with the FMT2500 fluorescence imaging system. Biodistribution was determined ex vivo using the Pearl fluorescent imager at 72 hours after injection. To mimic a clinical scenario, 2 animals underwent postmortem xenograft resection using both white-light and fluorescence guidance. Lastly, fresh and frozen human meningioma specimens were incubated ex vivo with bevacizumab-IRDye800CW, stained with anti-VEGF&#945;, and microscopically examined. In vivo, tumors fluoresced at all time points after tracer administration and background fluorescence decreased with time. Ex vivo analyses of tracer biodistribution showed the highest fluorescence in resected tumor tissue. Brain, skull, and muscle tissue showed very low fluorescence. Microscopically, fluorescence was observed in the cytoplasm and was correlated with VEGF&#945; expression patterns. During postmortem surgery, both the tumor bulk and a small tumor remnant were detected. Bevacizumab-IRDye800CW bound specifically to all tested human meningioma samples, as indicated by a high fluorescent signal in the tumor bulk compared with the surrounding healthy dura mater. Bevacizumab-IRDye800CW showed meningioma specificity, as illustrated by high VEGF&#945;-mediated uptake in the meningioma xenograft mouse model. Small tumor lesions were detected using fluorescence guidance. Thus, the next step will be to assess the feasibility of using already available clinical grade bevacizumab-IRDye800CW to optimize meningioma resection in a human trial. ",

        "AbstractText": "Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is the mainstay for treating brain metastases (BMs) from renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been applied to metastatic RCC and have contributed to improved outcomes. The authors investigated whether SRS with concurrent ICIs for RCC BM prolongs overall survival (OS) and improves intracranial disease control and whether there are any safety concerns. Patients who underwent SRS for RCC BMs at the authors' institution between January 2010 and January 2021 were included. Concurrent use of ICIs was defined as no more than 3 months between SRS and ICI administration. The time-to-event analysis of OS and intracranial progression-free survival (IC-PFS) between the groups with and without ICIs (ICI+SRS and SRS, respectively) was performed using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) based on propensity scores (PSs) to control for selection bias. Four baseline covariates (Karnofsky Performance Scale score, extracranial metastases, hemoglobin, and number of BMs) were selected to calculate PSs. In total, 57 patients with 147 RCC BMs were eligible. The median OS for all patients was 9.1 months (95% CI 6.0-18.9 months), and the median IC-PFS was 4.4 months (95% CI 3.1-6.8 months). Twelve patients (21%) received concurrent ICIs. The IPTW-adjusted 1-year OS rates in the ICI+SRS and SRS groups were 66% and 38%, respectively (HR 0.30, 95% C 0.13-0.69; p = 0.005), and the IPTW-adjusted 1-year IC-PFS rates were 52% and 16%, respectively (HR 0.30, 95% CI 0.14-0.62; p = 0.001). Severe tumor hemorrhage (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] grade 4 or 5) occurred immediately after SRS in 2 patients in the SRS group. CTCAE grade 2 or 3 toxicity was observed in 2 patients in the ICI+SRS group and 5 patients in the SRS group. Although the patient number was small and the analysis preliminary, the present study found that SRS with concurrent ICIs for RCC BM patients prolonged survival and provided durable intracranial disease control, with no apparent increase in treatment-related adverse events.

        "AbstractText": "Solar ultraviolet (UV) exposure of people and related health risk is mainly examined by estimating the received UV radiant exposure. However, for several effects such as DNA-damage, vitamin D photosynthesis or the probability of developing skin cancer, UV radiant energy is important and with that the size of exposed skin area. There is also a complex interaction between body shape and behavior like sun exposure habits, so that careful analysis is necessary when estimating health effects from UV exposure. In this paper, knowledge on body shape and methods of calculating the total body surface area (BSA) are summarized. BSA depends mainly on the height and weight of a person as well as on gender, ethnicity and body shape. BSA and body shape differ significantly between different populations and both change during life. This paper proposes formulas for BSA that consider height, weight, gender, ethnicity and body shape. As the exposed BSA depends on clothing, finally an approach is presented which aims to calculate the size of body parts released by real garments. In summary, this paper will enable future researchers to quantify the exposed BSA by best matching their study population and consequently investigate risks caused by solar UV exposure. ",

        "AbstractText": "The goal of cancer surgery is to achieve a \"clean\" microscopic resection, with no residual tumour remaining in the wound. To achieve that goal, the surgeon typically incorporates a measured buffer of grossly normal tissue about the entire circumference of the tumour. Microscopic analysis of the resection boundaries is then performed to determine if all traces of the tumour have been completely removed. This analysis is thought to provide a surrogate indication as to the likelihood for that tumour to recur after surgery. However, it is recognised that tumour recurrence may not occur even when microscopic evidence of tumour has been identified at the resection margins, and recurrence can also occur when conventional histology has considered the tumour to have been completely removed. The explanations for this dichotomy are numerous and include technical and practical limitations of the processing methodology, and also several surgeon-related and tumour-related reasons. Ultimately, the inability to confidently determine when a tumour has been removed sufficiently to prevent recurrence can impact on the ability to provide owners with confident treatment advice. In this article, the authors describe the challenges with defining the true extent of the tumour margin from the perspective of the surgeon, the pathologist and the tumour. The authors also provide an analysis of why our current efforts to ensure that all traces of the local tumour have been successfully removed may provide an imperfect assessment of the risk of recurrence.

The POLAR program aimed to assess efficacy and safety of CaM in the prevention of CIPN in patients treated with oxaliplatin in adjuvant (POLAR-A, ClinicalTrials.gov.NCT04034355) or metastatic (POLAR-M, ClinicalTrials.gov.NCT03654729) settings. Two randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials investigated patient-reported, moderate-to-severe CIPN 9&#8201;months after beginning folinic acid/5-fluorouracil/oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) therapy with or without CaM. In POLAR-A, patients with stage III or high-risk stage II CRC were randomized 1:1 to receive CaM 5&#8201;&#956;mol/kg or placebo.

The estimated relative risk for moderate-to-severe CIPN at month 9 was 1.37 (95%CI : 1.01-1.86; P =.045). A higher proportion of patients experienced serious hypersensitivity reactions across both trials with CaM treatment (3.6%) than with placebo (0.8%).

        "AbstractText": "Uterine fluid plays important roles in supporting early pregnancy events and its timely absorption is critical for embryo implantation. In mice, its volume is maximum on day 0.5 post-coitum (D0.5) and approaches minimum upon embryo attachment ~D4.0. Its secretion and absorption in ovariectomized rodents were shown to be promoted by estrogen and progesterone (P4), respectively. The temporal mechanisms in preimplantation uterine fluid absorption remain to be elucidated. We have established an approach using intraluminally injected Alexa Fluor&#8482; 488 Hydrazide (AH) in preimplantation control (RhoAf/f) and P4-deficient RhoAf/fPgrCre/+ mice. In control mice, bulk entry (seen as smeared cellular staining) via uterine luminal epithelium (LE) decreases from D0.5 to D3.5. In P4-deficient RhoAf/fPgrCre/+ mice, bulk entry on D0.5 and D3.5 is impaired. Exogenous P4 treatment on D1.5 and D2.5 increases bulk entry in D3.5 P4-deficient RhoAf/fPgrCre/+ LE while progesterone receptor (PR) antagonist RU486 treatment on D1.5 and D2.5 diminishes bulk entry in D3.5 control LE. The abundance of autofluorescent apical fine dots, presumptively endocytic vesicles to reflect endocytosis, in the LE cells is generally increased from D0.5 to D3.5 but its regulation by exogenous P4 or RU486 is not obvious under our experimental setting. In the glandular epithelium (GE), bulk entry is rarely observed and green cellular dots do not show any consistent differences among all the investigated conditions. This study demonstrates the dominant role of LE but not GE, the temporal mechanisms of bulk entry and endocytosis in the LE, and the inhibitory effects of P4-deficiency and RU486 on bulk entry in the LE in preimplantation uterine fluid absorption.

        "AbstractText": "TFIIH is a complex essential for transcription of protein-coding genes by RNA polymerase II, DNA repair of UV-lesions and transcription of rRNA by RNA polymerase I. Mutations in TFIIH cause the cancer prone DNA-repair disorder xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and the developmental and premature aging disorders trichothiodystrophy (TTD) and Cockayne syndrome (CS). 50% of TTD cases are caused by TFIIH mutations. Using TFIIH mutant patient cells from TTD and XP subjects we can show that the stress-sensitivity of the proteome is reduced in TTD, but not in XP. Using three different methods to investigate the accuracy of protein synthesis by the ribosome, we demonstrate that translational fidelity of the ribosomes of TTD, but not XP cells, is decreased. The process of ribosomal synthesis and maturation is affected in TTD cells and can lead to instable ribosomes. Isolated ribosomes from TTD patients show an elevated error rate when challenged with oxidized mRNA, explaining the oxidative hypersensitivity of TTD cells. Treatment of TTD cells with N-acetyl cysteine normalized the increased translational error-rate and restored translational fidelity. Here we describe a pathomechanism that might be relevant for our understanding of impaired development and aging-associated neurodegeneration. ",

        "AbstractText": "Children and adolescents who receive gonadotoxic treatments are at risk for future infertility. While there is a growing focus on integrating fertility preservation (FP) within pediatric cancer and blood disorder centers, wide variations in care models and methods exist across institutions. The purpose of this work is to describe the evolution of FP care models within a large pediatric hematology/oncology center. Models of care and associated timeframes are described, including a pre-FP program model, establishment of a formal FP program, integration of nurse navigators, and the addition of FP consult stratification based on urgency (urgent/nonurgent). The number of patient consults within each model, patient sex, diagnosis (oncologic/hematologic), and consult timing (pre-gonadotoxic treatment/posttreatment completion) were abstracted from the clinical database. The number of annual consults increased from 24 during the pre-FP program model (2015) to 181 during the current care model (2020). Over time, the proportion of consults for females and patients with nonmalignant hematologic disorders increased. Patient stratification reduced the proportion of consults needing to be completed urgently from 75% at the advent of the FP program to 49% in the current model. The evolution of care models within our FP program allowed for growth in the number of consults completed, expansion of services to more patients with nonmalignant hematologic disorders, and more consults for female patients. Nurse navigators play a critical role in care facilitating referrals, coordination, and patient education. Urgency stratification has allowed FP team members to manage increasing FP-related encounters. ",

        "AbstractText": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. Although cisplatin-based chemotherapy is commonly used in HNSCC, frequent development of cisplatin resistance is a potential cause of poor HNSCC prognosis. In the present study, we investigated the anticancer efficacy of a major paclitaxel metabolite namely 7-Epitaxol in cisplatin-resistant HNSCC. The findings revealed that 7-Epitaxol exerts cytotoxic effects in cisplatin-resistant HNSCC cell lines by inducing cell cycle arrest and intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Specifically, 7-Epitaxol increased Fas, TNF-R1, DR5, DcR3 and DcR2 expressions, reduced Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (anti-apoptotic proteins) expressions, and increased Bid and Bim L/S (pre-apoptotic proteins) expressions, leading to activation of caspase-mediated cancer cell apoptosis. At the upstream cell signalling level, 7-Epitaxol reduced the phosphorylation of AKT, ERK1/2 and p38 to trigger apoptosis. In vivo results showed that animals treated with 7-Epitaxol show antitumor growth compared to control animals. Taken together, the study demonstrates the potential anticancer efficacy of 7-Epitaxol in inducing apoptosis of cisplatin-resistant HNSCC cells through the suppression of AKT and MAPK signalling pathways.

Statistical methods were employed to analyse the data, including the Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm, and Cox regression analysis. The staining pan-succinyllysine antibody staining indicated that tumour tissues had a higher succinyllysine level than adjacent tissues (p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001), which could be associated with a worse prognosis (p&#160;=&#160;0.02).

        "ArticleTitle": "SNP rs9387478 at ROS1-DCBLD1 Locus is Significantly Associated with Lung Cancer Risk and Poor Survival in Indian Population. ",
        "AbstractText": "Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) are relevant therapeutic targets in the treatment of lung cancer. Germline susceptibility variants that influence these RTKs may provide new insights into their regulation. &#160;rs9387478 is located in the genomic interval between two RTK-genes ROS1/DCBLD1, of which ROS1 alterations are implicated in lung carcinogenesis and treatment response while the latter remains poorly understood. Venous blood was drawn from 100 control and 231 case subjects. Genotype was scored by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), PCR amplification followed by HindIII digestion. Logistic regression was applied to compare the association between variables. Survival curve was plotted to draw a correlation between the genotype and overall survival. Also, eQTL and chromatin state changes were analyzed and correlated with the survival of patients using available datasets. In our population smoking correlated significantly with lung cancer [OR= 2.607] with the presence of the minor allele 'A' enhancing the nicotine dependence [CA (OR=3.23)]. Individuals with homozygous risk allele 'A' had a higher chance of developing lung cancer [OR=2.65] than individuals with CA/CC implying a recessive model of association. Patients with CC/CA genotype had better overall survival than patients with AA genotype [161 days/142 days vs 54 days, p=0.005]. The homozygous risk allele was significantly associated with increased DCBLD1 and ROS1 expression in lung cancer, with enriched active histone marks due to the polymorphism. Interestingly, increased DCBLD1 expression was associated with poor outcomes in lung cancer. Overall, our study provides strong evidence that rs9387478 is significantly associated with both nicotine dependence and lung cancer in our North Indian cohort. The association of the SNP with prognostic genes, DCBLD1 and ROS1 make rs9387478 a promising prognostic marker in the North Indian population. The results obtained are significant, however, the study needs to be performed in a larger sample size. ",

        "AbstractText": "Although various improvements have been made in the reporting of the Papanicolaou (PAP) test in recent years, there remain several challenges that have yet to be addressed in terms of determining a standardized methodology for categorizing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC US). The present study focuses on evaluating the performance of the methylation status of two genes (CGB3 and NOP56) using a total of 200 PAP samples, which were divided into the \"determined\" group, with 78 samples based on cytology, and the \"undetermined\" group (ASC US), with 122 samples. The promoter methylation status of the CGB3 and NOP56 genes was detected for the 200 PAP samples using methylation specific PCR (MSP). The diagnostic abilities of the CGB3 and NOP56 genes in PAP samples were measured, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated using Python programming language. Based on the validation of CGB3 and NOP56 methylation in the 200 PAP samples, both genes exhibited higher methylation percentages in abnormal samples compared with normal samples. In addition, on the basis of diagnostic performance analysis, the CGB3 gene exhibited the highest sensitivity and specificity in both histology based ASC US and cytology based 'determined' PAP samples, with significant diagnostic abilities [area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.83 and 0.74, respectively, where AUC &#8805;0.5 was determined to be significant] to distinguish between the \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" samples. The findings of the present study will contribute toward identifying a DNA methylation marker for the early detection of abnormal samples before they reach the initial stages of cervical cancer, and should prove to be helpful for clinicians in terms of diagnosing patients whose cells are ASC US.<br />.

        "AbstractText": "Lysine-specific demethylase is a demethylase enzyme that can remove methyl groups from histones H3K4me1/2 and H3K9me1/2. It is expressed in many cancers, where it impedes differentiation and contributes to cancer cell proliferation, cell metastasis and invasiveness, and is associated with inferior prognosis. LSD1 is associated with its corepressor protein CoREST, and utilizes tetrahydrofolate as a cofactor to accept CH2 from the demethylation process. The fact that the cofactor is best bound to the active site inspired us to explore its interactions to LSD1/CoREST enzyme complex utilizing molecular dynamics simulation, which aids designing novel and potent inhibitors. In this study we minted to identify a new potential LSD1/CoREST inhibitors and test the potency and the safety of such inhibitors against human neuroblastoma and fibroblast cells lines. We have implemented a previously derived model from the molecular dynamics simulation study and the key contacts to the active site in a subsequent structure based drug design and in-silico screening, which revealed a number of potential inhibitors toward LSD1/CoREST complex. The anti-proliferative activities of the identified compounds will be tested against neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cancer cell line which known to highly express LSD1/CoREST complex. In-silico mining on National Cancer Institute (NCI) database identified 55 promising and structurally diverse inhibitors. Applying the abovementioned molecular modeling procedure yielded four compounds of LSD1/CoREST inhibiters with IC50 < 2&#181;M. The four lead compounds were tested against SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line that known to express high level of LSD1 and illustrated a potent activity with an IC50 ranging from 0.195 to 1.52&#181;M. To estimate the toxicity of the selective leads, they were tested against normal fibroblast cells and scored a relatively high IC50 ranging from 0.303 to &#8805; 100&#181;M. Our model revealed promising inhibitors that can be used in treating cancers that overexpress the LSD1 enzyme such as the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma. ",

        "AbstractText": "Colorectal cancer is a prevalent disease with a poor prognosis and is known as a heterogeneous disease with many differences in clinical Symptoms and molecular profiles. The present study aimed to systematically evaluate the association of SNPs in miRNA binding sites of target genes that are involved in CRC angiogenesis, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and cytoskeleton organization with tumorigenesis and metastasis of CRC. A case-control study was performed on 146 samples of CRC patients and 132 healthy samples. After that, the DNA of all samples was isolated by the salting-out method. Finally, the genotypes for EFNA1 SNP (rs12904) were identified by HRM (High-resolution melting analysis) method. In order to evaluate the results of genotyping, two samples from each genotype were sequenced using the sanger sequencing method. The frequency of AA genotype and the frequency of GG for rs12904 in satge4 and other stages are different from each other (P-value <0.0001) (P-value = 0.008). Also, the frequency of AA genotype in patients with different grades is different from each other (P-value = 0.035), while the frequency of AG &#160; genotype and the frequency of GG &#160; genotype is not significantly different in patients with different grades (P-value = 0.377) (P-value = 0.284). Results of this study indicated that patients carrying the GA and GG genotypes reduced the risk of disease progression compared to the AA genotype. As a result, this polymorphism plays a key role in CRC pathogenesis and metastasis and could be used as a biomarker in molecular diagnosis and metastatic state prediction in the near future after further study of its signaling pathways and molecular mechanism.

There are few studies that have examined survival in relapsed childhood ALL in resource-limited countries. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prognostic factors and survival outcome of relapsed childhood ALL in a major tertiary center in Southern Thailand. The medical records of patients with ALL aged <15 years between January 2000 and December 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to depict the overall survival (OS). A total of 472 patients with ALL were enrolled and relapsed ALL was found in 155 (32.8%) patients. Of these, 131 (84.5%) and 24 (15.5%) had B-cell and T-cell phenotypes, respectively. One hundred thirteen (72.9%) and 42 (27.1%) patients had early and late relapses, respectively. The most common site of relapse was bone marrow in 102 patients (65.8%). One hundred twenty-eight (82.6%) patients received treatment while 27 (17.4%) patients refused treatment. The 5-year OS of all relapsed patients was 11.9%. The 5-year OS among the patients with early relapse was significantly lower than in the patients with late relapse (5.3% vs. 29.1%, respectively, p <0.0001). Site and immunophenotype were not associated with survival of relapsed ALL. The median survival times among the patients who received and refused relapse chemotherapy were 11.8 and 3.1 months, respectively (p <0.0001). The relapse rate accounted for one third of patients with ALL with the 5-year OS of 12%. Early relapse and those who refused treatment were associated with poor survival outcome. ",

This study aimed, to explore whether the Glutathione S- transferase (GSTs) gene polymorphism has role in BC susceptibility. We further evaluated the frequency of four subtypes of BC based on molecular classification followed by microscopic histological analysis to study the grades of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Polymorphism in GST genes in North-Indian BC patients was assessed by multiplex-PCR and PCR-RFLP methods. 105 BC patients and 145 healthy controls were enrolled for this study. Data was analyzed by calculating the odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI from logistic regression analyses. Our findings revealed that GSTM1 null genotype (OR = 2.231; 95% CI = 1.332-3.737; p-value= 0.002) is significantly associated to BC risk in ethnic North- Indian population. However, the risk for BC susceptibility in North-Indians does not appear to be associated with GSTT1 null genotype. The GSTP1 (Val/Val) genotype (OR=1.545; CI=0.663-3.605; p-value= 0.314) was also found to be susceptible for BC risk. Combination of three high risk GST genotypes association exhibiting gene-gene interaction further confirmed the increased risk to BC in this region. The results of present study indicated that polymorphism in GSTM1 and rs1695 of GSTP1 genes may influence BC development among North-Indian women.

Moreover, these measurements were assayed in the most effective extract after incorporating Au-NPs. The study revealed that total methanolic extract exhibited the highest biological and cytotoxic activities as compared to other fractions. Therefore, it is considered as good candidate for nano-extract preparation. The methanolic extract incorporated with Au-NPs showed higher antioxidant, scavenging and cytotoxic activities in addition to higher inhibitory effect against &#945;-amylase activity as compared to native extract itself. To pinpoint active agents in total methanolic extract, the secondary metabolite profiling via HPLC-MS showed that 33 and 17 metabolites were annotated in the extract before and after incorporating Au-NPs, respectively. The median lethal dose (LD50) showed that gold total methanolic nano-extract is safer than total methanolic extract.

Patients with ipsilateral (contralateral) region and organ recurrence were 47.7% (19.8%) and 71.9%. Compared to the patients with none/partial compliance of aET, the full compliance patients (54.3% ) had a higher DFS (median 35.0 vs. 25.2 months, p=0.009). Multivariate analysis showed that the full compliance of aET was associated with a lower HR 0.614 (95%CI 0.467 - 0.807, p<0.001) on recurrence. Early discontinuation (67.5%, 56/83) due to the drug side effects was the top reason for partial compliance of aET. Full compliance of aET was quite low in Chinese HR+HER2- BC patients. However, it was associated with a 38.6% lower risk of first tumor recurrence. To search for effective tools to improve the compliance of aET in this population should be stressed. ",

To avoid unnecessary colposcopy, an efficient triage is still needed for validation. This study aimed to investigate the overall positivity of cytology-based screening, HPV detection, and p16/Ki-67 dual staining and evaluate different triage strategies for predictive diagnosis of abnormal cervical lesions in northeastern Thailand. Cervical cells were collected from 191 women who came for cervical screening in the gynecological outpatient department during March 2019-February 2020. Pap smear samples were classified into 6 groups including 17 atypical glandular cells (AGC), 21 atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), 7 atypical squamous cells - cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H), 26 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs), 19 high-grade SILs (HSILs) and 101 no squamous intraepithelial lesion (noSIL). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for HPV DNA detection. HPV genotyping was determined by reverse line blot hybridization. P16/Ki-67 dual staining was performed by using CINtec PLUS Cytology kit. Biopsies from abnormal screening were collected for surgical pathology classification. High-risk HPV (HR-HPV) infection was 2.97%, 29.41%, 38.10%, 57.14%, 46.15% and 84.21% in noSIL, AGC, ASC-US, ASC-H, LSIL and HSIL cytology respectively. P16/ Ki-67 in noSIL, AGC, ASC-US, ASC-H, LSIL and HSIL was 0.99%, 5.88%, 9.52%, 42.86%, 26.92% and 63.16%, respectively (P-value < 0.001). Among p16/Ki-67 positive cases, 96.15% (25/26) were infected with HPV and 84.62% (22/26) were HR-HPV. The overall positivity of each and co-testing between cytology or HPV DNA testing or p16/Ki-67 dual staining was evaluated. In each cervical lesion, primary HPV DNA testing showed the highest sensitivity, but low specificity. The combined all HPV/HR-HPV with p16/Ki-67 detection increased the specificity of abnormal cervical lesions. P16/Ki-67 dual stain cytology in HPV-positive women performs well for diagnosis of abnormal cervical lesions and should be considered for management of HPV-positive women to avoid unnecessary colposcopy referrals.

We retrospectively reviewed medical records of unvaccinated women received first-time cervical HPV screening in the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of University of Chinese Academy of Sciences between March 2018 and December 2019. HPV genotyping was examined by the GenoArray. Physical activity defined by any movements at speeds of 0.5-2 m/s was obtained from smartphones. We collected prestored physical activity data for 6 months prior to the HPV screening. Logistic regression models were applied to determine the association between physical activity and the risk of HPV infection and cervical cancer. A total of 11,730 women were initially included. Women with cervical cancer had significantly higher prevalence of infection with any high-risk (HR) HPV, or with individual HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58. Among them, 896 controls and 289 cervical cancer women had information of smartphone monitored physical activity. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that more daily physical activity time (or distance) was a protective factor for infection with any HR HPV, or infection with HPV16, but not other individual HPVs. Increased age, less physical activity time (or distance), and infection with any HR HPV (16, 18, 31, 52 and 58) were associated with a significantly increased risk of cervical cancer. In contrast, obesity was not associated with risk of HPV infection and cervical cancer. The high prevalence of HPV infection in unvaccinated women highlights the importance of prevention. More daily physical activity time (or distance) may help to reduce the risk of HPV infection and cervical cancer. Smartphone monitoring is an effective tool for recording physical activity.<br />. ",

The commercially available BBR chloride powder with purity &#8805; 95% was used in this study. Effects of BBR on cell growth of two human CCA cell lines, KKU-213A and KKU-213B were measured using MTT assay. The progressive phenotypes-cell adhesion, migration, and invasion were evaluated using cell adhesion, wound healing, and Boyden chamber assays. Molecular docking analysis was performed to assess the possible binding mode of BBR against EGFR, Erk, STAT3 and Akt. The effects of BBR on the activations of EGF/EGFR and its downstream effectors were demonstrated using Western blotting. BBR inhibited growth of CCA cells in a dose dependent manner. At sub-cytotoxic dose, BBR significantly inhibited cell adhesion, migration, invasion and decreased expression of vimentin, slug, and VEGFA of both CCA cell lines. Molecular docking suggested the simultaneous inhibitory activity of BBR on EGFR, Erk, STAT3 and Akt. The Western blot analyses revealed that upon the EGF/EGFR activation, BBR considerably attenuated the activations of EGFR, Erk, STAT3 and Akt. Low dose of BBR suppresses EMT and thus aggressiveness of CCA cells, in part by its multi-kinase inhibitor property on EGFR and its downstream pathways. &#160;BBR might be beneficial for therapy of human CCA.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study comparing PC and CG at Hatyai Hospital between 2012 and 2019. The primary outcome was survival analysis, and the secondary outcome was chemotherapy-related adverse events, and the rate and reason for stopping chemotherapy. The median overall survivals of both groups was comparable (9.0 months for the PC group and 9.6 months for the CG group; log-rank, p=0.287). The CG group had a higher incidence of adverse events (89.7% vs. 77.9%, p=0.010) and tended to have a lower rate of chemotherapy discontinuation (29.6% vs. 41.2%, p=0.080) than the PC group.

In lymphedema there is accumulation of fluid due to removal of lymph nodes which causes stretching of nerve fibres within the skin, compression on top of the nerve bundle leading to nerve entrapment. This will increase the neural mechanosensitivity and functional impairment of shoulder as a protective neural response to movement or traction. This study was carried out by assessing the total 72 breast cancer survivor women, with lymphedema. Out of 72, 28 of women underwent lumpectomy, 12 underwent quadrantectomy and 32 underwent unilateral mastectomy. &#160;These subjects were assessed for neural tissue mobility by taking pain assessment using visual analogue scale (VAS), range of motion (ROM) using goniometer, lymphedema measurement using an inch tape. The neural tissue mobility for &#160;median nerve, ulnar nerve and radial nerve was measured using limb tension test. The result obtained from this study showed that neural tissue mobility was significantly impaired in breast cancer survivors with lymphedema. The result of the upper limb tension tests showed 32 women with mild lymphedema had median nerve affected on the involved side 54.1%, about &#160;21 women had moderate lymphedema with 75% of women had median and 25% ulnar nerve affected with median nerve affected in majority of women.

This study of women who have undergone surgical intervention for breast cancer concludes that there was significant amount of neural tissue impairment noted to mechanical provocation test post operatively after 6 months of surgery. The study suggests that severity of lymphedema was directly related to the nerves affected due to neural tissue impairment. ",

        "AbstractText": "Animal environments for the growth of stem cells cause the transmission of some diseases and immune problems for the recipient. Accordingly, replacing these environments with healthy environments, at least with human resources, is essential. &#160;One of the media that can be used as an alternative to animal serums is Wharton acellular jelly (AWJ). &#160;Therefore, in this study, we intend to replace FBS with Wharton jelly and investigate its effect on the expression of megakaryocyte-related genes and markers in stem cells. In this study, cord blood-derived CD34 positive HSCs were cultured and expanded in the presence of cytokines including SCF, TPO, and FLT3-L. Then, the culture of expanded CD34 positive HSCs was performed in two groups: 1) IMDM culture medium containing 10% FBS and 100 ng / ml thrombopoietin cytokine 2) IMDM culture medium containing 10% AWJ, 100 ng / ml thrombopoietin cytokine. &#160;Finally, CD41 expressing cells were analyzed with the flow cytometry method. The genes related to megakaryocyte lineage including FLI1 and GATA2 were also evaluated using the RT-PCR technique. &#160;Results: The expression of CD41, a specific marker of megakaryocyte lineage in culture medium containing Wharton acellular jelly was increased compared to the FBS group. Additionally, the expression of GATA2 and FLI1 genes was significantly increased related to the control group. This study provided evidence of differentiation of CD34 positive hematopoietic stem cells from umbilical cord blood to megakaryocytes in a culture medium containing AWJ.<br />. ",

        "AbstractText": "The low general toxicity against tumors expressing globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and Shiga-like toxins produced by E. coli have been proposed as an anti-cancer therapy because of their specific target. This study aimed to determine the potency of the local strains of E. coli O157:H7 isolated from humans and cattle as a new breast cancer therapy by analyzing the cell cycle's inhibition and apoptosis induction. Approximately 10 cultured T47D cells were subjected to Shiga-like toxin produced by four local isolates of E. coli O157:H7, including KL-48 (2) from humans, and SM-25 (1), SM-7 (1), DS-21 (4) from cattle. Using ATCC 43894 as a control, the treatment was observed for 24 h by two replications. In addition, a FITC-Annexin V and PI assay were used to observe apoptosis and necrosis effect, as well as to analyze the cell cycle using propidium iodide (PI) staining. The results showed the toxicity effect of Shiga in the human T47 D cells line. The viability of the cells is subjected to Shiga-like toxins produced by KL-48 (2), SM7 (1), ATCC 43894, SM-25 (1), and DS-21 (4) isolates decreased with 15.20, 16.36, 22.17, &#160;22.64, and 33.86%, in contrary to control of 94.36%. These were supported by the cells entering the late apoptosis of the cell cycle through each isolate with 67.66, 62.60, 63.68, 63.90, and 54.74%, and a control of 0.01%. Also, the necrosis cell for each treatment of 12.73, 19.3, 10.84, 10.53, and 4.86% was higher than the control of 5.51%. These were confirmed by the higher percentage of the cells treated with toxins of KL-48 (2), SM7(1), ATCC 43894, SM-25 (1), and DS-21 (4), which entered G0-G1 of the cell cycle phase with 66.41, 63.37, 61.52, 55.36, and 47.28%, respectively, than control of 40.69%. Additionally, the toxicity effect was supported by an increase in the cells entering the S and the G2-M phase of the cycle for each treatment. It is concluded that the Shiga-like toxin produced by E. coli O157:H7 local isolates can be developed as a drug against breast cancer based on its effect to arrest induction of the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis.

Precise prediction of pathological complete response (pCR) will improve patient selection for W&W. We investigated the utility of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentomics in predicting pCR. We recruited 119 LARC patients and evaluated nCRT response by pCR status and pathological or MRI tumor regression grade (mrTRG). Plasma samples before, during, and after nCRT were applied to deep targeted-panel sequencing, with 103 patients having complete samples. cfDNA fragment and 5'-end motif profiles were used to construct elastic-net logistic regression models to predict non-pCR. Predictive performance was measured by area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. In the training cohort, the model based on 5'-end motif profile plus mrTRG achieved the highest cross-validation AUC (0.92, 95% CI, 0.91-0.93). The AUC in a testing cohort was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.90-1.00). The models based on 5'-end motif profile alone or in combination with mrTRG both maintained good predictive ability for patients without detectable circulating tumor DNA (AUC 0.94, 95% CI, 0.93-0.95; AUC 0.95, 95% CI, 0.94-0.96). In an external validation cohort, the model trained with a local 5'-end motif profile obtained an AUC of 0.878 (95% CI, 0.801-0.956) in discriminating colorectal cancer from healthy subjects. The combination of a 5'-end motif profile with mrTRG has the potential to predict the response to nCRT, and therefore may improve the patient selection for a W&W approach. ",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of proline metabolism-related genes and exogenous proline on the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). To further clarify the role of pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (PYCR) 2, a key enzyme of proline synthesis, in the regulation of colorectal intraperitoneal metastatic tumors. This study was carried out based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, database analysis, single-cell functional analysis, tissue microarray, cell experiments and animal models. We found that, PYCR2 mRNA and protein levels were upregulated in CRC. The mRNA level of PYCR2 was closely related to the prognosis and tumor metastasis of CRC patients. The upregulated PYCR2 expression was at least partly due to low promoter methylation level. The nomogram constructed based on PYCR2 expression and clinical characteristics of CRC showed good accuracy in predicting lymph node metastasis. Pycr2 knockdown inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of mouse CRC cells. Proline supplementation did not rescue the inhibition of mouse CRC cell proliferation and migration by Pycr2 knockdown. Proline supplementation also did not rescue the suppression of subcutaneous tumors and intraperitoneal metastatic tumors in mice by Pycr2 knockdown. PYCR2 co-expressed genes in TCGA-CRC were enriched in epigenetic modification-related biological processes and molecular functions. Four small molecules with the lowest binding energy to the PYCR2 protein were identified. Collectively, Pycr2 knockdown inhibited mouse CRC progression in a proline-independent approach. PYCR2 may be a promising tumor metastasis predictor and therapeutic target in CRC. ",

IMP1 binds to and stabilizes m6A-YAP mRNA, leading to activation of YAP/TAZ signaling depends on its m6A recognition and binding domain. On the other hand, TAZ functions as enhancer for IMP1 expression. Collectively, our data reveal a feedforward loop between IMP1 and YAP/TAZ maintaining GBM/GSC tumorigenesis and malignant progression, and a promising molecular target in GBM. ",

Pulmonary actinomycosis is clinically and radiologically analogous with tuberculosis, foreign body aspiration, lung abscess, or lung cancer. Therefore, it often causes misdiagnosis or delay in diagnosis. A 65-year-old male patient, being followed up with the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung adenocarcinoma, was admitted to our outpatient clinic with complaints of chronic cough. On chest CT, a cavitary lesion in the upper lobe of the right lung was observed. Sputum Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB) was negative for 3 consecutive times, fungal direct examination was negative, and there was no growth in mycobacterium culture and fungal culture. Flexible bronchoscopy revealed a raised, hard, white-colored lesion on the mucosa obliterating the apical and anterior segment bronchial entrance of the right lung upper lobe. A diagnosis of actinomycosis was made with sulfur granules seen in the pathology as a result of biopsy and lavage. Detection of sulfur granules in biopsy is essential for the diagnosis of actinomycosis, and a nearly complete response is usually obtained with long-term antibiotic treatment. Alternative methods such as surgical debridement should be considered in cases that do not respond to antibiotic treatment. ",

Also, 71% of the participants were aged between 31 and 50 years, mostly working in metropoles and tertiary hospitals for more than 5 years. Further, 63.7% of the participants expressed that they had knowledge about BCRL; however, detailed knowledge of lymphedema treatment was low, as 67.9% of the physiatrists reported that they had no comprehensive information about complete-decongestive-therapy. Nearly half of the participants did not believe that once lymphedema has clinically manifested, a patient can eventually be treated for BCRL. Also, 87% of the participants had attended less than two educational events related to BCRL in the past 5 years. In all, 94.7% of the physicians determined a great need for education and awareness of the current literature about BCRL. The awareness and knowledge of lymphedema is moderate but detailed information, knowledge, and education about lymphedema and its treatment are low among a group of physiatrists.

        "AbstractText": "High-grade urothelial carcinoma has a different molecular pathway than superficial low grade urothelial carcinoma, and is characterized by genomic instability. The high tumor mutation burden leads to neoantigen formation, evoking an immune response. The immune response has been keenly studied in last two decades and programmed death ligand-1 (PDL-1) has emerged as acceptable immunohistochemical marker for assessment of response to therapy, prognostication and patient selection for immunotherapy. The targeting of PD-1 and PDL-1 by checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) is an attractive strategy to unblock the inhibitor and induce cytotoxic cell death. However, the presence of complementary and companion diagnostic testing with multiple PDL-1 assays and platforms for various CPIs make a diagnostic quagmire. Thus, it is the need of hour to harmonize these assays. In this undertaken study we evaluated the concordance in PD-L1 expression between the two PD-L1 clones: SP263 and SP142, in treatment na&#239;ve muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).

We used immunohistochemistry marker expression (CK5/6, CK20, CD44, EGFR) as a surrogate marker, to stratify 150 cases of high-grade urothelial carcinoma into the intrinsic molecular subtypes. A correlation was also done with immunohistochemical markers p53, p21, E-cadherin and Ki-67. On subtyping, 47.3% cases were basal, 42.7% luminal and 10% remained unclassified. We did not find GATA3 useful for molecular stratification in our study. Muscle invasion was seen in 59% of basal and 31% of luminal subtype (P = 0.016). Squamous differentiation was most commonly associated with basal subtype (P < 0.001). EGFR expression was seen in 62% of basal and 38% of luminal subtype (P = 0.014), and thus can be used as an additional marker for molecular stratification. Overexpression of p53 was seen in 64% cases of muscle invasive and 36% of non-muscle invasive high-grade carcinomas (P < 0.0001). An inverse relationship was observed between p53 and p21 immunoexpression (r = -0.494) (P < .0001). The overall survival at 1- and 2-year interval was more in the luminal subtype, suggesting an early mortality in basal group, (P = 0.827), and at 6 years both the groups had almost similar results.

###Exercise 1
The friend in exercise 1 is trying to load too much data with their code, which is causing the MemoryError. The program needs more than 4 GB and even 8 GB to store all the data in the list. Instead of using a list, the friend can use an array, which uses significantly less bytes. This is because an array does not need to store metadata, such as value, data type, etc. A strategy to calculate the average without storing all the data is to use one value to store the sum of all the values instead of storing all the values. Then, you can divide by the total number of people to get the average.

###Exercise 2

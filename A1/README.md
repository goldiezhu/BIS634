Exercise 1:
To test more cases, add them with the human and chicken testers. This works with any testers so you can add more testers (e.g. dog_tester) and it will work.

Exercise 2:
There are 152361 rows and 4 columns. The four column categories are name, age, weight, and eyecolor. There are 152360 people.

The summary of the dataset and the distribution information is in the code. The distribution of ages is relatively uniform until the reported age is above 60 years old. This is expected because people have varying lifespans and there is a dramatic dropoff in the amount of people with longer lifespans. For weight, the weights below 60 to 80 kilograms tended to be measurements of the younger population. There is a consistent increase of weight with age so unless the person was suffering from a health issue, the weight measurements tended to be consistently increasing. The outliers were for people who were over- or under-weight for their age.
